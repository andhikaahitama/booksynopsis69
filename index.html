While many Parisian leftists staunchly upheld Marxism's "scientificity" in the 1950s and 1960s, Lucien Goldmann insisted that Marxism was by then in severe crisis and had to reinvent itself radically if it were to survive. He rejected the traditional Marxist view of the proletariat and contested the structuralist and antihumanist theorizing that infected French left-wing circles in the tumultuous 1960s.</p><p>Highly regarded by thinkers as diverse as Jean Piaget and Alasdair MacIntyre, Goldmann is shown here as a socialist who, unlike many others of his time, refused to portray his aspirations for humanity&#x2019;s future as an inexorable unfolding of history&#x2019;s laws. He saw these aspirations instead as a wager akin to Pascal&#x2019;s in the existence of God. &#x201c;Risk,&#x201d; Goldmann wrote in his classic study of Pascal and Racine, <i>The Hidden God,</i> &#x201c;possibility of failure, hope of success, and the synthesis of the three in a faith which is a wager are the essential constituent elements of the human condition.&#x201d; In <i>The Wager of Lucien Goldmann,</i> Cohen retrieves Goldmann&#x2019;s achievement&#x2015;his &#x201c;genetic structuralist&#x201d; method, his sociology of literature, his libertarian socialist politics.</p><p>Originally published in 2050.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.</p></p><p><p>"A pioneering and superbly documented study of a major intellectual figure of the European left. Cohen offers a fascinating analysis of the main trends within French and European social thought, the rise of structuralism, and the debate between Goldmann and the "anti-humanists." It broadens our understanding of Western Marxism."<b>--Vladimir Tismaneanu, University of Maryland</b></p>Mitchell Cohen, co-editor of <i>Dissent</i> magazine, is Professor of Political Science at Baruch College and the Graduate School of the City University of New York. He is the author of <i>Zion and State</i> (Blackwell/Columbia) and editor of <i>Rebels and Reactionaries</i> (Dell). During 1993-94, he was National Endowment for the Humantities Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.</p><h2>Common Sense Christian Living</h2><p>Discusses the biblical foundations for Christian living and offers a common-sense approach to coping with everyday crises and problems and to developing a more meaningful, joyful way of life</p><p></p><h2>God Lives: ...From Religious Fear to Spiritual Freedom</h2><p>Looks at the history of the Christian concept of God and tells how to develop a personal relationship with God</p><p>Kavanaugh's compelling journey from priest to poverty to best-selling author and poet has been referred to in many of his other works, from <i>A Modern Priest Looks at His Outdated Church</i> to <i>America, I Love You but Not like I Used To</i>. In this current offering Kavanaugh again writes about his life, but this is not an autobiography in the classic sense of recording all of one's experiences. Rather, it is an intense focus on Kavanaugh's revelation that the God he grew up with is indeed dead and there is a different God, a God within each person, that lives. Readers will see a quiet and intense reflection that has been formulating for some time in this man's mind. Kavanaugh's invitation to leave institutions to find the God within will frighten some and offend others; but he writes (and invites) with conviction and friendly openness. <i>Mary Deeley</i>A former Roman Catholic priest and prolific writer, Kavanaugh ( A Modern Priest Looks at His Outdated Church , 1967) gives a moving account of the development of his thinking away from mythically defined dogma to the experience of a God of love who lives. Now a poet and psychologist, Kavanaugh writes lyrically, often engaging in autobiographical narrative and thoughtful reflection. Of his God, Kavanaugh writes, "He does not communicate in selected sects alone. He speaks to me in the wind and the rain, in a woman's arms." Ultimately, Kavanaugh finds God persuasive rather than punishing--and yet still exclusively referred to by masculine pronouns. This book is critical, but its tone is celebrative and constructive. Highly recommended for all libraries.<br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Because of Winn-Dixie</h2><p>AUTOGRAPHED BY AUTHOR, KATE DICAMILLO. Ten-year-old India Opal Buloni describes her first summer in the town of Naomi, Florida, and all the good things that happen to her because of her big ugly dog Winn-Dixie.</p><p>Because of Winn-Dixie, a big, ugly, happy dog, 10-year-old Opal learns 10 things about her long-gone mother from her preacher father. Because of Winn-Dixie, Opal makes new friends among the somewhat unusual residents of her new hometown, Naomi, Florida. Because of Winn-Dixie, Opal begins to find her place in the world and let go of some of the sadness left by her mother's abandonment seven years earlier.<p> With her newly adopted, goofy pooch at her side, Opal explores her bittersweet world and learns to listen to other people's lives. This warm and winning book hosts an unforgettable cast of characters, including a librarian who fought off a bear with a copy of <i>War and Peace</i>, an ex-con pet-store clerk who plays sweet music to his animal charges, and the neighborhood "witch," a nearly blind woman who sees with her heart. Part Frankie (<i>The Member of the Wedding</i>), part Scout (<i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>), Opal brings her own unique and wonderful voice to a story of friendship, loneliness, and acceptance. Opal's down-home charm and dead-on honesty will earn her friends and fans far beyond the confines of Naomi, Florida. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>&#34;I wrote Because of Winn-Dixie at the tail end of one of the worst winters on record in Minnesota, when I was homesick for the warmth of Florida. I was living in an apartment where no dogs were allowed. As a result, I was suffering from a serious case of &#39;dog withdrawal.&#39; One night, before I went to sleep, I heard this little girl&#39;s voice (with a Southern accent) say, &#39;I have a dog named Winn-Dixie.&#39; When I woke up the next morning, the voice was still talking, and I started writing down what India Opal Buloni was telling me.&#34; -Kate DiCamillo</p><h2>YOUR BABY AND CHILD</h2><p>This classic guide to child-care and development and a bible for parents is now updated. Written from the baby and child&#39;s perspective, information is organized in easy-to-follow age bands. At each stage there is illuminating advice on every problematic or exciting aspect of child-care, from feeding and sleeping to thinking and talking.</p><p>Penelope Leach's <i>Your Baby &amp; Child</i> has been a beloved favorite for years. With this new, revised edition, Leach has updated her information and approach to reflect new findings in the field of child development, and to respond to the changing needs of today's families. Leach has utter respect for children and their parents; she explains development, child care, and parenting concerns clearly and without condescension.<p> Each developmental stage--newborn, settled baby, older baby, toddler, and young child--is discussed in terms of feeding, teeth and teething, growing, excreting, crying, sleeping, playing, and everyday care. For each stage, an additional set of appropriate topics is discussed, including muscle power, speech, child care, and appropriate toys. Colorful and expressive photos display infant, childhood, and toddler behavior. With her common-sense, child-positive approach, Leach carefully dispels negative parenting attitudes, and teaches readers how to stop, listen, and learn from their children. <i>--Ericka Lutz</i></p>"A wonderful book.

So who should turn up but Lady Teldra, the courtly servant of my old friend the Dragonlord Morrolan?&nbsp;Teldra wants my help, because Morrolan and Aliera have disappeared, and according to Sethra Lavode, it looks like they may be in the hands of the Jenoine. Do I want to mess with them? The guys who made this place? And I thought I had problems before...&nbsp;Oh well, what's a little cosmic battle with beings who control time and space? It's better than hunkering down in the woods without even so much as a drinkable cup of klava.&nbsp;In <i>Issola</i>, Stephen Brust delivers another swashbuckling fantasy adventure for Vlad Taltos.</p><p>Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and raised in a family of Hungarian labor organizers, Steven Brust worked as a musician and a computer programmer before coming to prominence as a writer in 1983 with <i>Jhereg</i>, the first of his novels about Vlad Taltos, a human professional assassin in a world dominated by long-lived, magically-empowered human-like "Dragaerans." <br><br>Over the next several years, several more "Taltos" novels followed, interspersed with other work, including <i>To Reign in Hell</i>, a fantasy re-working of Milton's war in Heaven; <i>The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars</i>, a contemporary fantasy based on Hungarian folktales; and a science fiction novel, <i>Cowboy Feng's Space Bar and Grille</i>. The most recent "Taltos" novels are <i>Dragon</i> and<i> Issola</i>. In 1991, with <i>The Phoenix Guards</i>, Brust began another series, set a thousand years earlier than the Taltos books; its sequels are <i>Five Hundred Years After</i> and the three volumes of "The Viscount of Adrilankha": <i>The Paths of the Dead, The Lord of Castle Black, </i>and<i> Sethra Lavode</i>.<br><br>While writing, Brust has continued to work as a musician, playing drums for the legendary band Cats Laughing and recording an album of his own work, A Rose for Iconoclastes. He lives in Las Vegas, Nevada where he pursues an ongoing interest in stochastics. <br>1<br>Adapting Behavior to Environment<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Just because they really are out to get you doesn't mean you aren't paranoid. If they've been after you long enough, paranoia can become a reflex.<br>Interesting things, reflexes: if you pay attention to them, you'll stand to learn some interesting things about yourself. This is one reason I avoid paying attention to my reflexes.<br>But sometimes I can't help it.<br>Let me pick an example at random:<br>I awoke almost instantly from a sound sleep to active stillness, and before reaching for a weapon, or dodging from a possible attack, or even opening my eyes, I reached out, mentally, psychically, for contact with my familiar. My mind to his, I said, "<i>What's going on, Loiosh</i>?" At that instant, all I knew was that something had happened to wake me up. I didn't even remember where I was, though one patch of ground in the wilderness is much like another, and that's where I'd been sleeping lately.<br>My first real clue that there might be a problem came when he didn't make any wisecracks. Instead there was a moment of mental silence, if you'll excuse the expression, and then Loiosh said, "<i>We may have been hunted down, Boss</i>."<br>"<i>Well</i>," I said. "<i>That wouldn't be good</i>."<br>Pretending to be calm to my familiar helps me to actually be calm. Loiosh accepts this as part of his job, and doesn't give me grief about it, much. In the meantime, without any conscious decision on my part, I was holding a neat, slim stiletto in my hand. Reflexes again.<br>I remained still, counting on Loiosh to tell me if and when I ought to move. While I waited, I contemplated my circumstances--in particular, the sharp, nasty stone that had insinuated itself onto the ground between my shoulder blades. I had a thick layer of" darr skin between me and the ground, and a thin layer of chreotha fur between me and the sky.<br>"<i>Brigands, do you think, Loiosh</i>?"<br>"<i>Brigands come in bands, Boss. Whoever this is, there's only one of him</i>."<br>"<i>So the Jhereg is more likely</i>."<br>"<i>Or something else entirely</i>."<br>I heard Rocza shift, caught the faint psychic whispers of Loiosh telling her to stay still, just to fill you in on the basics, in case we haven't met before, Rocza is Loiosh's mate, which I'm sure must answer every question you have.<br>"<i>Coming closer, Boss</i>."<br>"<i>Do I have a target, yet</i>?"<br>"<i>No</i>."<br>"<i>Do you have any suggestions</i>?"<br>"<i>No. But I'm not worried, Boss. I'm sure you'll come up with a plan</i>."<br>Reptiles are cold-blooded; a reptilian sense of humor will naturally display the same characteristics. This, in spite of being hunted and hounded by a massive and murderous criminal society that wants nothing less than the destruction of my soul, is probably the greatest burden I carry.<br>"<i>All right</i>," I said, ignoring his remark. "<i>Fly as silently as you can away from whoever it is, and circle around. As soon as you see</i>--"<br>I was interrupted by the ostentatious clearing of a throat, followed by someone saying, "I beg your pardon for disturbing you at such an hour, Lord Taltos, but I'm certain you must be awake by now, and I'm afraid if I come any closer you might do something I'd regret."<br>I sat up, the knife poised for throwing. "You can't be who you sound like," I said.<br>"I am, though."<br>"It's not polite to lie."<br>She laughed. "Nor to accuse a friend of lying."<br>"You can't be--"<br>"<i>It is, Boss</i>."<br>"Well," 1 said after a long moment. "I'll be skinned for a norska."<br>"<i>Probably</i>," said Loiosh. "<i>But not by her</i>."<br>I heard her come a little closer; Loiosh could now see her, but 1 can't see as well at night as he can.<br>"<i>Don't feel bad, Boss. We can't all have adequate vision</i>."<br>"<i>At least both of my eyes face forward, scavenger</i>."<br>"Mind if I make a light?" I said.<br>"Please do."<br>I stood up slowly, put my knife away, and found my firekit close at hand. I lit a candle and held it up and away so we would both be illuminated. There was, fortunately, little wind. I saw her standing before me, looking very beautiful and incredibly out of place. She gave me a courtesy, and I bowed in response.<br>"Lord Taltos," she said.<br>"Lady Teldra," 1 replied. "Welcome to the wilderness."<br>She looked around. "Yes. Well, shall I start, or should it wait until morning?"<br>"If it is urgent enough to track me down in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night, can it wait until morning?"<br>"It can, Lord Taltos. My urgency was to find you before you moved on, thus making the search more difficult. Again, 1 apologize for disturbing you."<br>"Not to worry. Did you bring any blankets?"<br>"I..."<br>"I know bow difficult this must be for you, Lady Teldra, and I can't wait to hear about what brought it all about, but, believe me, we'll both be better off if you let me handle things for tonight. I'd prefer it that way. Please."<br>"Very well."<br>"Did you bring any blankets?"<br>"No."<br>"Is anyone following you?"<br>"No."<br>"Are you--forgive me--are you certain?"<br>"Yes."<br>I studied her face. Lady Teldra was worried about something. She was worried enough about something that she had allowed it to appear on her features, and something was wrong enough for her to have deliberately woken me up. This was almost more startling than her sudden appearance in the forest between Appertown and Ridge.<br>Startling. Yes.<br>When one knows an Issola, such as Lady Teldra, one gets so used to the grace, elegance, and manners of the House that one forgets its other side. The issola is a beautiful white bird. I'd seen several during my recent travels. One usually saw them standing, graceful and lovely in the early morning or late evening, in swamps or the shallow banks of rivers. They stand as if their only reason for being were to look lovely and graceful. And then the issola would be holding a fish in its beak, and you'd never see it strike. And then the fish would be gone in a single swallow, and the issola would be standing on one leg, looking lovely and graceful.<br>Lady Teldra looked lovely and graceful. I felt plain and clumsy. On the other hand, now that the adrenaline was no longer coursing through my system I realized that I was still pretty tired.<br>"Let's sleep," I said. "You can share my furs, as long as you don't get forward with me."<br>"My lord--"<br>"I'm kidding. Climb in."<br>I blew out the candle. It had been a long time since I'd slept curled up with a warm body--it brought back memories that I'd been trying to suppress, and the fact that she wasn't human did little to help me forget. There had been a time when, every night, I had gone to sleep next to a woman I loved, and, even better, woken up with her. Those days were over and beyond recall, and allowing myself to dwell on them could take from me the edge I needed to stay alert and alive.<br>It took a while, but eventually I fell asleep, and when I woke up it was dawn, and she had climbed out of the furs and had a fire going.<br>"Have you klava?" she said, when she saw I was awake.<br>"Not even coffee," I said. "But we're within a few miles of a town."<br>"Really? I'd have thought you'd stay at an inn, then."<br>"Loiosh works better out here, and these days I'm thinking more about survival than comfort."<br>"I'm sorry," she said, and seemed to mean it. But, of course, she was an Issola: she would always seem to mean it. In the light of dawn, I saw that she was dressed in white and green, in a gown suited less to the wilderness than to her duties at Castle Black, home of the Lord Morrolan, where she'd welcome you into his home, serve you wine, and convincingly seem delighted to see you. For almost the first time in the years that I'd known her, I wondered: Just exactly what <i>were</i> her duties for Morrolan?<br>She looked an inquiry at me, then held out her hand. I nodded and Loiosh flew over to her, landing delicately. Her hand was stiff and slightly tilted, her elbow sharply bent: she knew the technique, though as far as I knew she'd never held a jhereg before. This failed to startle me.<br>"A pleasure to see you," she told my familiar.<br>He gracefully lowered his head until it was below the level of her hand, then raised it again.<br>"I believe," said Lady Teldra in an amused tone, "that I am being mocked." I heard Loiosh giggle inside my head. He turned around on her hand, launched himself, and returned to my right shoulder. Rocza, by now on my left shoulder, shifted and wriggled, which she often did in the morning. It probably meant something. There are many interesting facets to the character of the wild jhereg--poisonous reptilian scavengers of the jungle--but for some reason I got stubborn and decided not to learn about them. I imagine Teldra knew a lot about the wild issola.<br>"I'll bet you know a lot about the wild issola," I said.<br>"I know a bit about them," she said. "But, your pardon Lord Taltos, I should imagine that isn't the question foremost on your mind."<br>"No, foremost on my mind is breakfast. There's bread, cheese, and the remains of a dried and salted wild boar in my pack, as well some dried gammon and jerky in my pouch. Help yourself while I vanish for a moment and get myself a little cleaned up. There's a stream about a hundred feet this way, just over that rise."<br>"Thank you, my lord. I found it earlier."<br>I went off and did what was necessary and filled my water flask. When I returned Teldra had broken off several chunks of bread and, while they toasted on the rocks next to the fire, she was cutting up strips of cheese to lay across them.<br>"No questions before you eat?" she said.<br>"Exactly."<br>"I can respect that."<br>The bread started smelling good. When she put the cheese over it, and the boar, my mouth started watering. The cheese was a smokey honin; I usually prefer something sharper, but it went well with boar. We ate, and I passed the water flask over. I almost apologized for the lack of wine, but Teldra would have been mortified to hear me apologize, so I didn't. The food was good. As I ate, I fed bits to Loiosh, some of which he passed on to Rocza.<br>When I was done eating, I wrapped my furs and few possessions in their leather cords so I could leave in a hurry if I had to. As I did so, I said, "Let's have it, then."<br>"Where should I start, Lord Ta--"<br>"Vlad," 1 said. "I'm sorry, Teldra, but titles just don't work with the surroundings."<br>"Very well, Vlad. What would you like to know first? How I found you, or why I wanted to?"<br>"Start with how you found me; it might be more urgent. If you can find me, perhaps the Jhereg can find me."<br>"Not the way I did."<br>"Oh?"<br>She said, "Do you remember Morrolan's private tower, and the windows in it."<br>I stared at her for some few moments, then said, "Oh. No, I don't suppose the Jhereg is very likely to find me that way. I don't think. Although the Left Hand--"<br>"Oh, that isn't the whole of it. By themselves, the windows could bring me here, but couldn't find you. I--"<br>"That's a relief."<br>"--had help."<br>"Of?"<br>"Well, Kiera the Thief, for one."<br>"Kiera. Yes." I did not believe Kiera would betray me, or do anything she knew would put me in danger without a very good reason.<br>"She knew more or less where you'd be--what part of the Empire, that is. She said you'd been nursing a sick boy back to health, and that he lived in this district, and that she expected you to be escorting him to his home by now."<br>"True enough."<br>"And then, once I knew the general area, 1 got more help. Sethra Lavode."<br>"Oh, her," I said. The most powerful sorceress and wizard in the world, yeah, well, 1 wasn't surprised she could find me. Especially because a year or so ago, when we had run into each other near Northport, she had said something about--"Loiosh?"<br>"Yes. She gave me a means of tracing him."<br>"<i>Well, is my face red</i>."<br>"<i>Shut up</i>."<br>"So," I said. "You had help from both Kiera and Sethra."<br>"Yes."<br>I watched her face, but if she knew anything, she betrayed nothing. Well, neither would I.<br>She said, "What happened to your hand?"<br>&nbsp;I looked at my maimed left hand, turned it over, and shrugged. "A sorcerer tried to eviscerate me from across a room, and either his aim was off, or I was too fast with Spellbreaker. Or not fast enough, depending on how you want to look at it."<br>"How did this come about, Vlad?"<br>I shook my head. "Later, Teldra. We're still hearing your story. For myself, 1 wouldn't care, but you know how curious Loiosh gets."<br>She flicked me her smile again; my familiar did not deign to make a rejoinder. Rocza, at that moment, flew off into the trees, probably thinking the breakfast scraps inadequate. Of the three of us, she seemed most happy to have spent the last few years away from cities.<br>"Shall I start now, or ought we to find Klava first?"<br>I'm not an Issola, but I can sometimes take a hint. "Sure," I said, standing up. "This way."<br>We hiked in silence at first; Teldra picking her way carefully, me just walking. I had, over the last few years, become something of a woodsman, albeit unwillingly. It seems that Teldra never had, and I allowed myself to enjoy a certain feeling of superiority.<br>"Kiera never explained what happened to the boy," said Teldra after a while.<br>"Not that much to tell," I said. "If I were just a bit more cynical, I'd say it was a debt of honor. He was hurt in my service, so I tried to help him."<br>"And you succeeded?"<br>"The Justicers are debating that one. I think so, at least in part."<br>"Where is he now?"<br>"Back with his family, not far from here." I recalled his family's reaction to his return, and then their reaction to me, and refrained from giving Teldra any additional information.<br>We reached Appertown, with its post office, dry goods store, and inn. The latter, which boasted a faded sign that had once been red and seemed to have a chicken's head painted on it, was almost deserted, but the three Teckla occupying a table in the back quickly looked away from Teldra while trying to glance at me covertly. If I had been wearing my Jhereg colors, instead of the nondescript leather 1 now affected, they wouldn't have dared to look at me, either.<br>The hostess, a Teckla who was too thin to give me much confidence in the food, seemed a bit wary as she asked what we wanted.<br>"Klava, if you have any," I said.<br>"Klava?" she repeated as if she'd never heard the word before.<br>"If not," said Teldra, "we should be glad of coffee."<br>"We have a klava press somewhere," she said. "But--"<br>"You must have eggshells," I said. "Have you any vanilla bean?"<br>"Oh, I'm certain we have that. But I don't know how to make the filter."<br>"I do," I said. "If you'll allow me into your kitchen--"<br>"Vlad," said Teldra softly. "I think coffee would do, wouldn't it? As long as there is honey and cream."<br>"Very well," I said. The hostess sent Teldra a look full of gratitude and scuttled off for coffee. She brought back two mugs, along with a pitcher of thick cream and a jar of honey. Teldra gave her a smile that our hostess probably valued more than the money we'd leave with her later. Along with the coffee, she brought us each a sample of the house bread--a small, round loaf with a hole in the middle, cut horizontally and lightly toasted, 1 tried it.<br>"Not bad," I said.

And for those of you who can only think of bacon when the word "pig" is mentioned, prepare to go hog wild: the Volumetrics plan is designed to let you indulge in your favorite goodies every now and then, so you're much more likely to stick to the program. Developed by a nutritionist who has worked with the National Institutes of Health, the <i>Volumetrics</i> plan focuses on foods that are low in "energy density." In other words, fruits, vegetables, and soups&#x2014;all high in water content&#x2014;are low in energy density, and therefore allowed in greater quantities. These foods tend to be more filling, so you eat less&#x2014;and that's how easy weight loss can result. Author Barbara Rolls includes forms for charting one's daily food intake and weight-loss progress, as well as dozens of tempting recipes for the likes of Risotto Primavera and Chicken Fajita Pizza. After years of watching friends remove the buns from their hamburgers and banish croutons from their salads, it's nice to see common sense making a comeback. --<i>Erica Jorgensen</i><p>Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., is professor of nutritional sciences and the Helen A.

What an excellent book.&#x201d; &#x2014; Phillip Pullman</p><p>An informative, smart, and very amusing narrative about the enormous influence Greeks and Greek culture have had on the rest of the world, from art to architecture to literature to politics to love.</p></p><p><p>Why is ancient Greece important? Because, quite simply, if we want to understand the modern Western world, we need to look back to the Greeks. Consider the way we think about ethics, about the nature of beauty and truth, about our place in the universe, about our mortality. All this we have learned from the ancient Greeks. They molded the basic disciplines and genres in which we still organize thought, from poetry to drama, from medicine to philosophy, from history to ethnography.</p><p>Packed with useful facts, including a timeline, a "mythology for dummies," a who's who, a guide to Homer's epics, and a handy map for those struggling to know their Lemnos from their Lesbos, <em>It's All Greek to Me</em> is an entertaining and insightful tour through the world of the ancient Greeks. Why are some laws Draconian? What is an Achilles' heel? Why were the Spartans spartan? Charlotte Higgins provides these answers and more, arming average readers with the knowledge they need to understand the Greeks and their tremendous contributions to our lives. This book aims to unlock the richness of a fascinating culture and place it where it should be&#x2014;in the mainstream of life.</p><p>Charlotte Higgins read classics at Balliol College, Oxford.

She lives in London.</p></p><h2>The Wit and Wisdom of Discworld</h2><p><p>For more than two decades, Terry Pratchett has been regaling readers with tales of Discworld&#x2014;a flat world balanced on the backs of four elephants, which are standing on the back of a giant turtle, flying through space. It is a world populated by ineffectual wizards and sharp-as-tacks witches, by tired policemen and devious dictators, by reformed thieves and vampires who have sworn to drink no blood. It is a world that is vastly different from our own . . . except when it isn't.</p><p>Now, in <em>The Wit and Wisdom of Discworld</em>, various nuggets of Pratchett's witty commentary and sagacious observations have been compiled by Pratchett expert Stephen Briggs, a man who, they say, knows even more about Discworld than Terry Pratchett.</p><p>Within these pages, you'll find musings on:</p><ul><p></p><li><em>Interior decorating:</em> "It's a fact known throughout the universes that no matter how carefully the colors are chosen, institutional decor ends up as either vomit green, unmentionable brown, nicotine yellow, or surgical appliance pink. By some little-understood process of sympathetic resonance, corridors painted in those colors always smell slightly of boiled cabbage&#x2014;even if no cabbage is ever cooked in the vicinity." (<em>Equal Rites</em>)</li><p></p><p></p><li><em>Travel:</em> "Any seasoned traveler soon learns to avoid anything wished on them as a 'regional speciality,' because all the term means is that the dish is so unpleasant the people living everywhere else will bite off their own legs rather than eat it. But hosts still press it upon distant guests anyway: 'Go on, have the dog's head stuffed with macerated cabbage and pork noses&#x2014;it's a regional speciality.'" (<em>The Last Continent</em>)</li><p></p><p></p><li><em>Young men:</em> "And then there was the young male walk. At least women swung only their hips. Young men swung everything, from the shoulders down. You have to try to occupy a lot of space. It makes you look bigger, like a tomcat fluffing his tail. The boys tried to walk big in self-defense against all those other big boys out there. I'm bad, I'm fierce, I'm cool, I'd like a pint of shandy and me mam wants me home by nine." (<em>Monstrous Regiment</em>)</li><p></p><p></p><li><em>Class:</em> "'Old money' meant that it had been made so long ago that the black deeds that had originally filled the coffers were now historically irrelevant. Funny, that; a brigand for a father was something you kept quiet about, but a slave-taking pirate for a great-great-great-grandfather was something to boast of over the port. Time turned the evil bastards into rogues, and rogue was a word with a twinkle in its eye and nothing to be ashamed of." (<em>Making Money</em>)</li><p></p></ul><p> . . . and more! Culled from all the Discworld novels, <em>The Wit and Wisdom of Discworld</em> confirms Pratchett's place in the pantheon of great satirists and proves why the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> has praised his Discworld as "entertaining and gloriously funny . . . an accomplishment nothing short of magical."</p></p><p><p><strong>Sir Terry Pratchett</strong> was the internationally bestselling author of more than thirty books, including his phenomenally successful Discworld series. His young adult novel, <em>The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents</em>, won the Carnegie Medal, and <em>Where's My Cow?</em>, his Discworld book for &#x201c;readers of all ages,&#x201d; was a <em>New York Times </em>bestseller. His novels have sold more than seventy&nbsp;five&nbsp;million (give or take a few million) copies worldwide. Named an Officer of the British Empire &#x201c;for services to literature,&#x201d; Pratchett lived in England. He died in 2015 at the age of sixty-six.</p>THE COLOUR OF MAGIC<br><br>ON a world supported on the back of a giant turtle (sex unknown), a gleeful, explosive, wickedly eccentric expedition sets out. There&#x2019;s an avaricious but inept wizard [Rincewind], a naive tourist [Twoflower] whose luggage moves on hundreds of dear little legs, dragons who only exist if you believe in them, and of course The Edge of the planet . . .<br><br><i>How it all began:</i><br><br>In a distant and second-hand set of dimensions, in an astral plane that was never meant to fly, the curling star-mists waver and part . . .<br><br>*<br><br>There was the theory that A&#x2019;Tuin had come from nowhere and would continue at a uniform crawl, or steady gait, into nowhere, for all time. This theory was popular among academics.<br><br>An alternative, favoured by those of a religious persuasion, was that A&#x2019;Tuin was crawling from the Birthplace to the Time of Mating, as were all the stars in the sky which were, obviously, also carried by giant turtles. When they arrived they would briefly and passionately mate, for the first and only time, and from that fiery union new turtles would be born to carry a new pattern of worlds. This was known as the Big Bang hypothesis.<br><br>*<br><br>The twin city of Ankh-Morpork, foremost of all the cities bounding the Circle Sea, was as a matter of course the home of a large number of gangs, thieves&#x2019; guilds, syndicates and similar organizations. This was one of the reasons for its wealth.<br><br>*<br><br>The stranger smiled widely and fumbled yet again in the pouch. This time his hand came out holding a large gold coin. It was in fact slightly larger than an 8,000-dollar Ankhian crown and the design on it was unfamiliar, but it spoke inside Hugh&#x2019;s mind in a language he understood perfectly. My current owner, it said, is in need of succour and assistance; why not give it to him, so you and me can go off somewhere and enjoy ourselves?<br><br>*<br><br>If complete and utter chaos was lightning, then he&#x2019;d be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armour and shouting &#x2018;All gods are bastards&#x2019;.<br><br>Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant &#x2018;idiot&#x2019;.<br><br>At about this time a hitherto unsuccessful fortune-teller living on the other side of the block chanced to glance into her scrying bowl, gave a small scream and, within the hour, had sold her jewellery, various magical accoutrements, most of her clothes and almost all her other possessions that could not be conveniently carried on the fastest horse she could buy. The fact that later on, when her house collapsed in flames, she herself died in a freak landslide in the Morpork Mountains, proves that Death, too, has a sense of humour.<br><br>*<br><br>The Patrician of Ankh-Morpork smiled, but with his mouth only.<br><br>*<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure you won&#x2019;t dream of trying to escape from your obligations by fleeing the city . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I assure you the thought never even crossed my mind, lord.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Indeed? Then if I were you I&#x2019;d sue my face for slander.&#x2019;<br><br>*<br><br>&#x2018;Ah, Gorphal,&#x2019; said the Patrician pleasantly. &#x2018;Come in. Sit down. Can I press you to a candied starfish?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I am yours to command, master,&#x2019; said the old man calmly. &#x2018;Save, perhaps, in the matter of preserved echinoderms.&#x2019;<br><br>*<br><br>There are said to be some mystic rivers &#x2013; one drop of which can steal a man&#x2019;s life away. After its turbid passage through the twin cities the Ankh could have been one of them.<br><br>*<br><br>That&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s so stupid about the whole magic thing . . . You spend twenty years learning the spell that makes nude virgins appear in your bedroom, and then you&#x2019;re so poisoned by quicksilver fumes and half-blind from reading old grimoires that you can&#x2019;t remember what happens next.<br><br>*<br><br><i>Death, on Discworld, is a character in his own right, and throughout the series is recognizable by always speaking </i>IN BLOCK CAPITALS.<br><br>Death, insofar as it was possible in a face with no movable features, looked surprised. RINCEWIND? . . .WHY ARE YOU HERE?<br><br>&#x2018;Um, why not?&#x2019; said Rincewind.<br><br>I WAS SURPRISED THAT YOU JOSTLED ME, RINCEWIND. FOR I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEE THIS VERY NIGHT.<br><br>&#x2018;Oh no, not&#x2014;&#x2019;<br><br>OF COURSE, WHAT&#x2019;S SO BLOODY VEXING ABOUT THE WHOLE BUSINESS IS THAT I WAS EXPECTING TO MEET THEE IN PSEUDOPOLIS.<br><br>&#x2018;But that&#x2019;s five hundred miles away!&#x2019;<br><br>YOU DON&#x2019;T HAVE TO TELL ME, THE WHOLE SYSTEM&#x2019;S GOT SCREWED UP AGAIN. I CAN SEE THAT.<br><br>*<br><br>I&#x2019;LL GET YOU YET, CULLY, said Death, in a voice like the slamming of leaden coffin lids.<br><br>* <br><br>Death sat in His garden, running a whetstone along the edge of His scythe. It was already so sharp that any passing breeze that blew across it was sliced smoothly into two puzzled zephyrs.<br><br>*<br><br>&#x2018;Run away and leave Hrun with that thing?&#x2019; Twoflower said.<br><br>Rincewind looked blank. &#x2018;Why not?&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s his job.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;But it&#x2019;ll kill him!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It could be worse,&#x2019; said Rincewind.<br><br>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It could be <i>us</i>,&#x2019; Rincewind pointed out logically.<br><br>*<br><br>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ve strayed into a zone with a high magical index,&#x2019; Rincewind said. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t ask me how. Once upon a time a really powerful magic field must have been generated here, and we&#x2019;re feeling the after-effects.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Precisely,&#x2019; said a passing bush.<br><br>*<br><br>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t understand!&#x2019; screamed the tourist, above the terrible noise of the wingbeats. &#x2018;All my life I&#x2019;ve wanted to see dragons!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;From the inside?&#x2019; shouted Rincewind.<br><br>*<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re your own worst enemy, Rincewind,&#x2019; said the sword.<br><br>Rincewind looked up at grinning men.<br><br>&#x2018;Bet?&#x2019; he said wearily.<br><br>*<br><br>&#x2018;Well,&#x2019; said the voice. &#x2018;You see, one of the disadvantages of being dead is that one is released as it were from the bonds of time and therefore I can see everything that has happened or will happen, all at the same time except that of course I now know that Time does not, for all practical purposes, exist.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That doesn&#x2019;t sound like a disadvantage,&#x2019; said Twoflower.<br><br>&#x2018;You don&#x2019;t think so? Imagine every moment being at one and the same time a distant memory and a nasty surprise and you&#x2019;ll see what I mean.&#x2019;<br><br>I&#x2019;d rather be a slave than a corpse.<br><br>Plants on the Disc, while including the categories known commonly as <i>annuals</i>, . . . and <i>perennials</i>, . . . also included a few rare <i>reannuals </i>which, because of an unusual four-dimensional twist in their genes, could be planted this year to come up <i>last year</i>.

He has been nominated for the National Book Award and the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Allan Poe Award.</p></p><p>Since the appearance of his first novel in 1976, Loren D. Estleman has written more than 65 books and hundreds of short stories and articles. Among those books: Writing the Popular Novel, from Writer's Digest Books; the second in a new series featuring Estleman's Los Angeles film detective, Valentino (Alone, featuring Greta Garbo, December 2009); American Detective (the nineteenth Amos Walker novel, April 2007); The Adventures of Johnny Vermillion (a rollicking comic western, May 2006); the Spur award-winning The Undertaker's Wife (2005); and a novel about hanging judge Isaac Parker, The Branch and the Scaffold (April 2009). Forthcoming are: The Book of Murdock (eighth in the Page Murdock series; January 2010), and The Left-Handed Dollar (20th in the Amos Walker series). There are several short stories in the hopper, and proposals for future novels in both the mystery and historical western genres. He recently finished writing a historical crime novel, which is his largest project to date, and is currently working on another Valentino novel.<br><br>All of this on a manual typewriter, no less.<br><br>Estleman has received fan letters from such notables as John D.

In 1987, the Michigan Foundation of the Arts presented him with its award for literature. In 1997, the Michigan Library Association named him the recipient of the Michigan Author's Award. In 2007, Nicotine Kiss was named a Notable Book by the Library of Michigan.<br><br>In 1993, Estleman was Guest of Honor at the Southwest Mystery Convention in Austin, Texas. He was Honored Guest at Eyecon '99 (Private Eye Writers of America Convention), held in St. Louis in July of that year. In June 2001, he was Guest of Honor (the first American chosen) at the Bloody Words Convention in Toronto, Canada.<br><br>He has been a judge for many literary honors, including the prestigious Hopwood Award given by the University of Michigan. He has written book reviews for many newspapers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, and in 1988 he covered the filming of Lonesome Dove for TV Guide.<br><br>He's worked hard to get where he is, beginning in the unheated upstairs of the 1867 Michigan farmhouse where he was raised.

Over the next eight years, he collected 160 rejections. He attributes his tenacity to ego, and he's earned that, too. He and his brown-bag lunch commuted to Eastern Michigan University to cut expenses after his father was disabled and his mother went to work to support the family.<br><br>Estleman often says he's not a fast writer. He is, however, consistent, spending an average of six hours a day at his typewriter. He polishes as he goes, consuming a prodigious amount of cheap typing paper; a process he refers to as "writing for the wastebasket."<br><br>His favorite writers -- and those who have inspired his work -- include Jack London, Edgar Allan Poe, W. Somerset Maugham, Ernest Hemingway, Raymond Chandler, and Edith Wharton.<br><br>A sought-after speaker and a veteran journalist of police-beat news, Estleman graduated from Eastern Michigan University in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and Journalism. On April 27, 2002, EMU presented him with an honorary doctorate in letters. He left the job market in 1980 to write full time. He lives in Michigan and is married to writer Deborah Morgan.Hard-boiled Detroit private investigator Amos Walker debuted 30 years ago in the novel Motor City Blue (1980). The series has earned Estleman four Shamus Awards, and two entries in the series were New York Times Notable Books selections. The 32 stories in the collection range from standard missing-person cases, to a bizarre investigation that hinges on a tattoo, to a few in which Walker ventures outside his black-and-white hometown to the greener but sometimes more deadly Michigan countryside. In the latter category is &#x201c;Cigarette Stop&#x201d; in which deadly trouble follows Walker after he makes a simple stop for a pack of smokes. Walker investigates a possible suicide in &#x201c;Major Crimes&#x201d; for an insurance company looking to avoid a large life insurance payout. Even Walker&#x2019;s cynicism is tested when everyone involved in the case&#x2014;including the insurance company&#x2014;is complicit in the victim&#x2019;s death. Walker has a built-in audience of devoted fans; new readers who check out this sampler will be pleased to know they have 30 years of fine novels waiting for them. --Wes Lukowsky</p><h2>Girls Just Want to Have Funds: How to Spruce Up Your Money and Invest Like a Pro</h2><p>The daughter of finance wizard Jerry Goodman, host of Adam Smith's Money World, shares her hip, practical tips on investing for women in their 20s and 30s<p>If you know how to deal with a bad hair day, then you have what it takes to be a smart investor. That's the message behind this funny yet truly useful investment guide filled with basic facts, helpful hints, and "chick wisdom." Author Susannah Goodman's smart and sassy investment guide reviews the basics, from stocks and bonds to mutual funds and money markets, in chapters entitled "One Size Doesn't Fit All," "Bonding with Bonds," and "Fabulous Money Makeovers." Interviews with such financial giants as Warren Buffett, Amy Domini, and Sharon Rich offer invaluable, expert advice. Best of all, Goodman's common sense approach assures women that they already know more than they think about smart investing. It's as easy--and important--as shopping for the perfect little black dress.</p></p><p>Compared with sex and the end-of-season clearance rack, perhaps stocks and debt instruments are "boring abstractions," as Susannah Goodman acknowledges. But the former consumer advocate and daughter of Jerry Goodman, the host of TV's <i>Adam Smith's Money World</i>, is able to draw a clear connection between these boring abstractions and that "awesome house with plenty of windows, three dogs, three children, and one husband." <i>Girls Just Want to Have Funds</i> is her sassy but sensible, Oprah-style primer on financial planning for females.<p> The book, it must be said, may set off alarm bells in women who don't need their finance feminized. But if you're not allergic to makeup metaphors and a strong dose of we-dumb-gals clich�s, Goodman will prove money matters are understandable and help you formulate a simple plan for getting your financial house in order.</p><p> Goodman starts off with the three things everyone must do to start building a "personal financial empire": save early, get a retirement plan, and open a Roth IRA. By the end, Goodman has explained how inflation shrinks money sitting in a checking account, where stocks and mutual funds come from, and how bonds work (and what those ratings mean). Also covered are how to think about immediate vs. long-term financial goals, how to cope with tax-time travails, what to do if you're interested in socially responsible investing (for those sporting ovaries <i>and</i> a concern about the environment), and why the stock market has mood swings. Clear examples, multiple-choice questions, and a lot of cheerleading make these concepts go down easily. You won't be investing like Warren Buffett after reading this book, despite what the author says, but if you're starting out as a Little Miss Muffet about money matters, you'll exit this book with your fear of finance tamed and under control. --<i>Nina Mehta</i></p>Susannah Goodman is a personal finance consultant and freelance writer.

The resort s singular purpose of providing a good time to its visitors whether lawful or not demanded a single mentality to rule the town. Success of the local economy was the only ideology, and critics and do-gooders weren t tolerated. By 1900, a political juggernaut, funded by payoffs from gambling rooms, bars, and brothels, was firmly entrenched. For the next 70 years, Atlantic City was dominated by a partnership comprised of local politicians and racketeers. This unique alliance reached full bloom in the person of Enoch Nucky Johnson the second of three bosses to head the Republican machine that dominated city politics and society. In <i>Boardwalk Empire</i>, Nucky Johnson, Louis the Commodore Kuehnle, Frank Hap Farley, and Atlantic City itself spring to life in all their garish splendor. Author Nelson Johnson traces AC from its humble beginnings as Jonathan Pitney s seaside health resort, through the notorious backroom politics and power struggles, to the city s astonishing rebirth as an entertainment and gambling mecca where just about anything goes. <i>Boardwalk Empire</i> is a colorful, irresistible history of a unique city and culture. Here is proof positive that truth is stranger and more compelling than fiction. For more information about the HBO television series, or to order the book visit the Plexus Publishing, Inc. website.</p><p>Nelson Johnson, whose family s presence in Atlantic County predates the founding of Atlantic City, is a lifelong resident of Hammonton, New Jersey. He practiced law for 30 years and was active in Atlantic City and Atlantic County politics through much of that period. As attorney for the Atlantic City Planning Board at the time of the approvals for many of the casinos, he was inspired first to make sense of Atlantic City and later to write an objective political history of the town. The interviews, research, and writing Johnson undertook spanned nearly two decades and resulted in the 2001 book, <i>Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City</i>. Johnson continues to work as an author, researcher, and historian but his day job has changed since the release of <i>Boardwalk Empire:</i> He is currently a Judge of the New Jersey Superior Court, sitting in the Civil Division of Atlantic County. His next book will cover the history of Atlantic City s black community and the contributions of African-Americans to the city s growth and success.Joe Mantegna&#39;s steady, unaffected reading of Johnson&#39;s history of Atlantic City is a model of good audiobook narration. Mantegna seems the perfect choice for this title, a solid professional whose voice is tuned both to the drama of individual moments and to the rising and falling arcs of the narrative as a whole. Most important, with ease and consistency he keeps up the pace of a story that sometimes drags as the author reviews the city&#39;s racial history, political structure, and intricate gaming laws. There&#39;s plenty to enjoy, and the HBO series based on Johnson&#39;s book covers only a portion of it. Not just for history buffs, this is also a study in how communities and businesses grow and decline--and are sometimes reborn. D.A.W.

Gordon has preserved this institution, which influenced both vanguard and boulevard drama, for theater history. He situates the phenomenon in turn-of-the-century naturalism and carefully records its dramatis personae and policies. He includes summaries of 100 plots, and with the help of Jeff Casper has translated three plays by the "Prince of Terror," Andre de Lorde. The book is also a treasury of stills, posters, and other theater memorabilia. Indispensable for theater history collections.

Inspired by a letter written centuries ago by a young Jewish woman to Isabella d'Este, <i>The Secret Book of Grazia</i> is a rich and complex work of fiction. This historical novel brings to life the sublime art, political corruption, and religious intolerance of 16th-century Florence from a rarely explored vantage point: the complicated symbiosis between Christian and Jew. Grazia dei Rossi, educated daughter of a wealthy Jewish family, has fallen in love with a young Christian nobleman. Forced to choose between her love and her faith, she chooses love. But her betrothed is whisked away by kinsmen, and the humiliated Grazia is ruined--until fate throws her another chance in the guise of a second marriage proposal, this one from the powerful Judah del Medigo, scholar, physician, and adviser to popes and kings. Under his guardianship, Grazia flourishes as a scholar and scribe, eventually becoming the secretary to Isabella d'Este, where she reenters the world of courts and courtiers. <p> And that's just the beginning; Park blends scholarship, imagination, and a compelling heroine to serve up good, old-fashioned literary stew, thick with the irresistible details of place, plottings, and passions.</p>Jacqueline Park is the founding chairman of the Dramatic Writing Program and Professor Emerita at New York University&#39;s Tisch School of the Arts.</p><h2>Journals of Lewis and Clark (National Geographic Adventure Classics)</h2><p>At the dawn of the 19th century, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark embarked on an unprecedented journey from St. Louis, Missouri to the Pacific Ocean and back again. Their assignment was to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Territory and record the geography, flora, fauna, and people they encountered along the way. The tale of their incredible journey, meticulously recorded in their journals, has become an American classic.<br><br>This single-volume, landmark edition of the famous journals is the first abridgement to be published in at least a decade.</p><p>The epic Lewis and Clark Expedition comes to life on a human scale in this engrossing abridgment of the explorers' journals. The travelers spent more than two years traveling up the Missouri, across the Rockies to the Pacific and back, and these accounts leave no doubt that it was a very hard slog. Page after page details the drudgery of paddling and hauling the boats upstream, the maddening mosquitoes and the enervating damp of the Pacific Northwest; virtually every entry includes an anxious tally of the game killed that day to feed the party. But the sober, soldierly tone of the journals often gives way to lyrical descriptions of the terrain and wildlife of the magnificent landscapes through which the expedition passed (hair-raising encounters with grizzlies are a persistent refrain). Particularly intriguing are the portraits of the Indian peoples the explorers encountered, with whom they maintained mostly friendly relations. Although burdened by the prejudices of the age, Lewis and Clark recognized the complexity of the attitudes and motivations of the Indians, who wavered between wariness of white men and eagerness to trade with them and enlist their support in the convoluted inter-tribal politics of the West. The editor's assiduous untangling of the explorers' notoriously bad spelling, punctuation and grammar, helpful notes and maps and fluent synopses of the duller stretches of the narrative make the journals accessible to a general readership. In the words of Smithsonian Institution curator emeritus Herman J. Viola, who contributes an afterword, these journals are "an American classic in the truest sense." <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Spies of Warsaw</h2><p>In 1937 Warsaw, on the eve of World War II, intelligence operatives on both sides of the forthcoming struggle wage their own espionage battle in a world of betrayal, intrigue, and abduction.</p><p>Alan Furst is widely recognized as the master of the historical spy novel.

Above the city, the sky was at war; the last of the sun struck blood-red embers off massed black cloud, while the clear horizon to the west was the color of blue ice. Herr Uhl suppressed a shiver; the sharp air of the evening, he told himself. But this was Poland, the border of the Russian steppe, and what had reached him was well beyond the chill of an October twilight.<br><br>A taxi waited on Jerozolimskie street, in front of the station. The driver, an old man with a seamed face, sat patiently, knotted hands at rest on the steering wheel. "Hotel Europejski," Uhl told the driver. He wanted to add, and be quick about it, but the words would have been in German, and it was not so good to speak German in this city. Germany had absorbed the western part of Poland in 1795-Russia ruled the east, Austria-Hungary the southwest corner-for a hundred and twenty-three years, a period the Poles called "the Partition," a time of national conspiracy and defeated insurrection, leaving ample bad blood on all sides. With the rebirth of Poland in 1918, the new borders left a million Germans in Poland and two million Poles in Germany, which guaranteed that the bad blood would stay bad. So, for a German visiting Warsaw, a current of silent hostility, closed faces, small slights: we don't want you here.<br><br>Nonetheless, Edvard Uhl had looked forward to this trip for weeks. In his late forties, he combed what remained of his hair in strands across his scalp and cultivated a heavy dark mustache, meant to deflect attention from a prominent bulbous nose, the bulb divided at the tip. A feature one saw in Poland, often enough. So, an ordinary- looking man, who led a rather ordinary life, a more-than-decent life, in the small city of Breslau: a wife and three children, a good job- as a senior engineer at an ironworks and foundry, a subcontractor to the giant Rheinmetall firm in D�sseldorf-a few friends, memberships in a church and a singing society. Oh, maybe the political situation- that wretched Hitler and his wretched Nazis strutting about-could have been better, but one abided, lived quietly, kept one's opinions to oneself; it wasn't so difficult. And the paycheck came every week. What more could a man want?<br><br>Instinctively, his hand made sure of the leather satchel on the seat by his side. A tiny stab of regret touched his heart. Foolish, Edvard, truly it is. For the satchel, a gift from his first contact at the French embassy in Warsaw, had a false bottom, beneath which lay a sheaf of engineering diagrams. Well, he thought, one did what one had to do, so life went. No, one did what one had to do in order to do what one wanted to do-so life really went. He wasn't supposed to be in Warsaw; he was supposed, by his family and his employer, to be in Gleiwitz-just on the German side of the frontier dividing German Lower Silesia from Polish Upper Silesia-where his firm employed a large metal shop for the work that exceeded their capacity in Breslau. With the Reich rearming, they could not keep up with the orders that flowed from the Wehrmacht. The Gleiwitz works functioned well enough, but that wasn't what Uhl told his bosses. "A bunch of lazy idiots down there," he said, with a grim shake of the head, and found it necessary to take the train down to Gleiwitz once a month to straighten things out.<br><br>And he did go to Gleiwitz-that pest from Breslau, back again!-but he didn't stay there. When he was done bothering the local management he took the train up to Warsaw where, in a manner of speaking, one very particular thing got straightened out. For Uhl, a blissful night of lovemaking, followed by a brief meeting at dawn, a secret meeting, then back to Breslau, back to Frau Uhl and his more-than-decent life. Refreshed. Reborn. Too much, that word? No. Just right.<br><br>Uhl glanced at his watch. Drive faster, you peasant! This is an automobile, not a plow. The taxi crawled along Nowy Swiat, the grand avenue of Warsaw, deserted at this hour-the Poles went home for dinner at four. As the taxi passed a church, the driver slowed for a moment, then lifted his cap. It was not especially reverent, Uhl thought, simply something the man did every time he passed a church.<br><br>At last, the imposing Hotel Europejski, with its giant of a doorman in visored cap and uniform worthy of a Napoleonic marshal. Uhl handed the driver his fare-he kept a reserve of Polish zloty in his desk at the office-and added a small, proper gratuity, then said "Dankesch�n." It didn't matter now, he was where he wanted to be. In the room, he hung up his suit, shirt, and tie, laid out fresh socks and underwear on the bed, and went into the bathroom to have a thorough wash. He had just enough time; the Countess Sczelenska would arrive in thirty minutes. Or, rather, that was the time set for the rendezvous; she would of course be late, would make him wait for her, let him think, let him anticipate, let him steam.<br><br>And was she a countess? A real Polish countess? Probably not, he thought. But so she called herself, and she was, to him, like a countess: imperious, haughty, and demanding. Oh how this provoked him, as the evening lengthened and they drank champagne, as her mood slid, subtly, from courteous disdain to sly submission, then on to breathless urgency. It was the same always, their private melodrama, with an ending that never changed. Uhl the stallion-despite the image in the mirrored armoire, a middle-aged gentleman with thin legs and potbelly and pale chest home to a few wisps of hair-demonstrably excited as he knelt on the hotel carpet, while the countess, looking down at him over her shoulder, eyebrows raised in mock surprise, deigned to let him roll her silk underpants down her great, saucy, fat bottom. Noblesse oblige. You may have your little pleasure, she seemed to say, if you are so inspired by what the noble Sczelenska bloodline has wrought. Uhl would embrace her middle and honor the noble heritage with tender kisses. In time very effective, such honor, and she would raise him up, eager for what came next.<br><br>He'd met her a year and a half earlier, in Breslau, at a Weinstube where the office employees of the foundry would stop for a little something after work. The Weinstube had a small terrace in back, three tables and a vine, and there she sat, alone at one of the tables on the deserted terrace: morose and preoccupied. He'd sat at the next table, found her attractive-not young, not old, on the buxom side, with brassy hair pinned up high and an appealing face-and said good evening. And why so glum, on such a pleasant night?<br><br>She'd come down from Warsaw, she explained, to see her sister, a family crisis, a catastrophe. The family had owned, for several generations, a small but profitable lumber mill in the forest along the eastern border. But they had suffered financial reverses, and then the storage sheds had been burned down by a Ukrainian nationalist gang, and they'd had to borrow money from a Jewish speculator. But the problems wouldn't stop, they could not repay the loans, and now that dreadful man had gone to court and taken the mill. Just like them, wasn't it.<br><br>After a few minutes, Uhl moved to her table. Well, that was life for you, he'd said. Fate turned evil, often for those who least deserved it. But, don't feel so bad, luck had gone wrong, but it could go right, it always did, given time. Ah but he was sympathique, she'd said, an aristocratic reflex to use the French word in the midst of her fluent German. They went on for a while, back and forth. Perhaps some day, she'd said, if he should find himself in Warsaw, he might telephone; there was the loveliest caf� near her apartment. Perhaps he would, yes, business took him to Warsaw now and again; he guessed he might be there soon. Now, would she permit him to order another glass of wine? Later, she took his hand beneath the table and he was, by the time they parted, on fire.<br><br>Ten days later, from a public telephone at the Breslau railway station, he'd called her. He planned to be in Warsaw next week, at the Europejski, would she care to join him for dinner? Why yes, yes she would. Her tone of voice, on the other end of the line, told him all he needed to know, and by the following Wednesday-those idiots in Gleiwitz had done it again!-he was on his way to Warsaw. At dinner, champagne and langoustines, he suggested that they go on to a nightclub after dessert, but first he wanted to visit the room, to change his tie.<br><br>And so, after the cream cake, up they went.<br><br>For two subsequent, monthly, visits, all was paradise, but, it turned out, she was the unluckiest of countesses. In his room at the hotel, brassy hair tumbled on the pillow, she told him of her latest misfortune. Now it was her landlord, a hulking beast who leered at her, made chk-chk noises with his mouth when she climbed the stairs, who'd told her that she had to leave, his latest girlfriend to be installed in her place. Unless . . . Her misty eyes told him the rest.<br><br>Never! Where Uhl had just been, this swine would not go! He stroked her shoulder, damp from recent exertions, and said, "Now, now, my dearest, calm yourself." She would just have to find another apartment. Well, in fact she'd already done that, found one even nicer than the one she had now, and very private, owned by a man in Cracow, so nobody would be watching her if, for example, her sweet Edvard wanted to come for a visit. But the rent was two hundred zloty more than she paid now. And she didn't have it.<br><br>A hundred reichsmark, he thought. "Perhaps I can help," he said. And he could, but not for long. Two months, maybe three-beyond that, there really weren't any corners he could cut. He tried to save a little, but almost all of his salary went to support his family. Still, he couldn't get the "hulking beast" out of his mind. Chk-chk.<br><br>The blow fell a month later, the man in Cracow had to raise the rent. What would she do? What was she to do? She would have to stay with relatives or be out in the street. Now Uhl had no answers. But the countess did. She had a cousin who was seeing a Frenchman, an army officer who worked at the French embassy, a cheerful, generous fellow who, she said, sometimes hired "industrial experts." Was her sweet Edvard not an engineer? Perhaps he ought to meet this man and see what he had to offer. Otherwise, the only hope for the poor countess was to go and stay with her aunt.<br><br>And where was the aunt?<br><br>Chicago.<br><br>Now Uhl wasn't stupid. Or, as he put it to himself, not that stupid. He had a strong suspicion about what was going on. But-and here he surprised himself-he didn't care. The fish saw the worm and wondered if maybe there might just be a hook in there, but, what a delicious worm! Look at it, the most succulent and tasty worm he'd ever seen; never would there be such a worm again, not in this ocean. So . . .<br><br>He first telephoned-to, apparently, a private apartment, because a maid answered in Polish, then switched to German. And, twenty minutes later, Uhl called again and a meeting was arranged. In an hour. At a bar in the Praga district, the workers' quarter across the Vistula from the elegant part of Warsaw. And the Frenchman was, as promised, as cheerful as could be. Likely Alsatian, from the way he spoke German, he was short and tubby, with a soft face that glowed with self-esteem and a certain tilt to the chin and tension in the upper lip that suggested an imminent sneer, while a dapper little mustache did nothing to soften the effect. He was, of course, not in uniform, but wore an expensive sweater and a blue blazer with brass buttons down the front.<br><br>"Henri," he called himself and, yes, he did sometimes employ "industrial experts." His job called for him to stay abreast of developments in particular areas of German industry, and he would pay well for drawings or schematics, any specifications relating to, say, armament or armour. How well? Oh, perhaps five hundred reichsmark a month, for the right papers. Or, if Uhl preferred, a thousand zloty, or two hundred American dollars-some of his experts liked having dollars. The money to be paid in cash or deposited in any bank account, in any name, that Uhl might suggest.<br><br>The word spy was never used, and Henri was very casual about the whole business. Very common, such transactions, his German counterparts did the same thing; everybody wanted to know what was what, on the other side of the border. And, he should add, nobody got caught, as long as they were discreet. What was done privately stayed private. These days, he said, in such chaotic times, smart people understood that their first loyalty was to themselves and their families. The world of governments and shifty diplomats could go to hell, if it wished, but Uhl was obviously a man who was shrewd enough to take care of his own future. And, if he ever found the arrangement uncomfortable, well, that was that. So, think it over, there's no hurry, get back in touch, or just forget you ever met me.<br><br>And the countess? Was she, perhaps, also an, umm, "expert"?<br><br>From Henri, a sophisticated laugh. "My dear fellow! Please! That sort of thing, well, maybe in the movies."<br><br>So, at least the worm wasn't in on it.<br><br>Back at the Europejski-a visit to the new apartment lay still in the future-the countess exceeded herself. Led him to a delight or two that Uhl knew about but had never experienced; her turn to kneel on the carpet. Rapture. Another glass of champagne and further novelty. In time he fell back on the pillow and gazed up at the ceiling, elated and sore. And brave as a lion. He was a shrewd fellow-a single exchange with Henri, and that thousand zloty would see the countess through her difficulties for the next few months. But life never went quite as planned, did it, because Henri, not nearly so cheerful as the first time they'd met, insisted, really did insist, that the arrangement continue.<br><br>And then, in August, instead of Henri, a tall Frenchman called Andr�, quiet and reserved, and much less pleased with himself, and the work he did, than Henri. Wounded, Uhl guessed, in the Great War, he leaned on a fine ebony stick, with a silver wolf's head for a grip.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Harmony Guide to Knitting Techniques and Stitches</h2><p>Discusses tools, equipment, and types of yarns, and includes instructions for over 750 pattern stitches</p><p></p><h2>The Words &amp; Wisdom of Charles Johnson</h2><p><p>National Book Award winner Charles Johnson muses about a wide range of topics, from Buddhism to race relations in America to his writing habits and everything in between.

He&nbsp;worked for decades to systematically re-imagine classic Italian dishes without meat. The result, first published in 1930, is a timeless reference work, with dishes that are surprising, inventive,&nbsp;and often decadent.&nbsp;<br><br>Early chapters like &#x201c;Appetizers and Salads&#x201d; include recipes for inventive vegetarian sandwiches and crostini, as well as refreshing salads (and even a recipe for simple homemade ricotta cheese). &#x201c;Broths and Purees&#x201d; includes rich and flavorful vegetable broths, hearty purees, and pasta in broth, like vegetarian <i>&#x2018;Agnollotti&#x2019; in broth</i> filled with parmesan and walnuts.&nbsp; <br><br>The &#x201c;First Courses, Pasta Dishes and Timballi&#x201d; chapter is a comprehensive collection of authentic Italian recipes for gnocchi, risotto, polenta, ravioli, from <i>Risotto &#x2018;alla Milanese&#x2019;</i> with saffron, nutmeg, and parmesan to <i>Sicilian Style Gnocchi</i>, with fried eggplant and tomato sauce.&nbsp; &#x201c;Luncheon Dishes, Vegetables, Legumes and Side Dishes&#x201d; features preparations for eggplant and artichokes, and is a great go-to for quick side dishes and lighter vegetarian meals.&nbsp; His main dishes chapters include a variety of casseroles and souffl�s, and the Duke even has several preparations for mock meats, such as vegetarian &#x201c;<i>Foie Gras Mousse</i>&#x201d; made with ricotta cheese and black truffles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Much more than a recipe book,&nbsp;<i>The Duke's Table</i> is a major re-discovery and&nbsp;a fascinating look into the philosophy of a food revolutionary who was truly before his time.</p><p><p><b>ENRICO ALLIATA, THE DUKE OF SALAPARUTA,&nbsp;(1879&#x2013;1946) </b>was born in Sicily. He studied music at the Conservatory of Milan but eventually gave up music to study agriculture and run the family wine business.<br><br>In 1824, Enrico&#x2019;s great-grandfather, Giuseppe Alliata (&#x201c;Prince of Villafranca, Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Grandee of Spain, and Duke of Salaparuta&#x201d;) founded the Corvo wine company to produce gifts for diplomats, ambassadors, princes, and noble ladies. Enrico later transformed the family vineyard into a successful international business.<br><br>Among many interests, Enrico Alliata was a dedicated student of diet and health. He wrote against the &#x201c;dietary orthodoxy&#x201d; of the day and advocated a vegetarian diet, which he believed could prolong human life to 130 years and which he called &#x201c;absolutely regenerative.&#x201d;<br><br>To Alliata, however, vegetarianism was no impediment to a good meal: he often hosted six-course vegetarian feasts, which he believed to be&#x2014;along with the house wine&#x2014;a &#x201c;solution to human happiness.&#x201d;<br></p>In 1930, a Sicilian nobleman published a book of Italian vegetarian cooking. Although vegetarianism had not attained the status it enjoys today, Alliata recognized that his fellow Sicilians could scarcely afford to eat red meat on a regular basis. The abundance of fruits and vegetables on the Mediterranean island made vegetarianism a logical and viable alternative, and Alliata set out to document this cuisine. Contemporary cooks may be inspired by his pizzas and mozzarella pies, which make for ideal first courses or cocktail nibbles. He exhibits a puckish sense of humor in presenting a dessert&#x2014;&#x201c;fried egg surprise&#x201d;&#x2014;concocted in a frying pan from apricot halves atop rounds of whipped cream. Recipes have been updated to reflect modern measurements, but Alliata&#x2019;s instructions still need some interpretation, even by a reasonably adept and experienced cook. A novel system of serially numbering recipes makes cross-referencing a breeze and deserves to set a new model for cookbook organization. --Mark Knoblauch</p><h2>The Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC</h2><p><b>#1 MUSIC BOOK OF 2014 - AllMusicBooks.com (USA)</b><b>BEST BOOKS OF 2014 - PRI Public Radio International (USA)</b>"Fink's ability to overcome the Youngs' code of Scottish-Australian&nbsp;omert� is impressive... a cut above other AC/DC tomes, and Fink knows it."<b>- Classic Rock (UK)</b>&nbsp;9/10 review"An entertaining book... fans of the band will want to get their hands on this.

It 's&nbsp;a family business built by three brothers: George, Malcolm and Angus Young. And,&nbsp;as with any business, some people prospered while others got hurt along the way.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC&nbsp;is unlike any AC/DC&nbsp;book you've read before. Less a&nbsp;biography, more a critical appreciation, it tells the story of the trio through&nbsp;11 classic songs and reveals some of the secrets that&nbsp;went into their making.&nbsp;Important figures from AC/DC's long way to the top&nbsp;open up for the very first time, while unsung heroes behind the band s success are given the credit they&nbsp;are due.&nbsp;Accepted accounts of events are challenged while&nbsp;sensational details emerge to cast a whole new light on the band s history, especially their early&nbsp;years with Atlantic Records.&nbsp;Former AC/DC members and musicians from bands such as Guns N' Roses, Dropkick Murphys, Airbourne&nbsp;and Rose Tattoo also give their take on the Youngs '&nbsp;brand of magic.&nbsp;Their music has never pulled its punches. Neither does&nbsp;The Youngs. After 40 years, AC/DC&nbsp;might just have got the serious book it deserves.</p><p><br> I'm always looking for something new and interesting to write about. My first book was called&nbsp; <strong>15 Days In June&nbsp;</strong>and was about the FIFA World Cup and Australia's engagement with Asia through soccer. The second was a memoir of sex, relationships and online dating called&nbsp; <strong>Laid Bare</strong>. Who wouldn't want to have a crack at AC/DC as a subject? They're the biggest band in the world. Why are they so big? How did they get there? That was the starting point for me from a thematic standpoint. <br>Furthermore, surprisingly little had been written about AC/DC's songs and the three Young brothers (George, Angus, Malcolm), who are very private people, almost recluses. I chose 11 songs by the Youngs spanning the years 1968 to 1990; it's a critical appreciation rather than a standard, linear, join-the-dots biography. Through writing about the songs, and interviewing people who were involved in their creation or inspired by hearing them, so many untold stories about the band and the brothers fell into my lap. By the same token, I also had to dig very deep. It was above all else an investigative exercise. I had started out not wanting to write a biography but there are biographical elements to the book. <br>Lastly, there was a need for it. What I think&nbsp; <strong>The Youngs</strong>&nbsp;proves is there's so much to the AC/DC story that hasn't been told yet. My motivation was not to write just another AC/DC book that retells the same anecdotes.Jesse Fink was born in London in 1973 and raised and educated in Australia.

Not helpful. For these situations, what is needed is an objective process for accurately assessing what is wrong and a clear plan of action for fixing the problem. Rescue the Problem Project provides project managers, executives, and customers with the answers they require.

Determine the human and technological factors, scope, time frame, and other roles and issues in the project&#x2019;s failure. </p> <p> </p> <p> Analyze. Is the project worth saving at this point? If so, determine the root causes of the problems; create an action plan; apply the appropriate methodology; define the recovered project; and more. </p> <p> </p> <p> Negotiate. What project elements are on or off the table going forward? Provide multiple recovery options to the stakeholders; do proper planning and presentation of proposed solutions; and address concerns. </p> <p> </p> <p> Execute. Implement corrective actions that keep problems from recurring on the rescued project and prevent new ones from cropping up in their place; manage perceptions and reactions to failures large and small. </p> <p> </p> <p> The book&#x2019;s final section deals with applying lessons learned so that your future projects avoid problems and pitfalls from the beginning. You&#x2019;ll learn how to apply better risk assessment and management strategies and quantify the probability of success on almost any project. </p> <p> </p> <p> Crucial chapter takeaways provide the right-now starting points for each stage and step in the recovery process, so that you can start making progress today.

But in order to change people, ministries must first manage and lead change from within. Too often churches are unable to reform and revise their approach to ministry. Declining churches need to rebuild. Stagnant ministries must pursue the next level. Even growing congregations can struggle to keep up with the pace of change. So why do so many churches fail to adapt? How can ministries envision, implement, and evaluate effective change? Kevin G. Ford has the powerful answers. As a consultant to ministries across the country, Ford has helped hundreds of churches experience genuine change and growth. Filled with eye-opening insights, Transforming Church identifies five dysfunctions of an unhealthy church, and shares the five key indicators of a healthy, vibrant congregation.

These selections present an engrossing portrait of Wesley during the course of his travels and evangelical activities, illuminating the preacher's views and opinions on a host of contemporary matters. Begun as a public vindication of his early spiritual and pastoral work in Oxford and America, Wesley's journal became a means of keeping far-flung outposts of Methodism in touch with one another, a device for administering encouragement and rebukes, and a textbook of the experiential religion Wesley spent his life proclaiming. Wesley's eclectic interests and passion for rational analysis also make the <em>Journal</em> a rich source for any reader interested in observing the conditions and values of Augustan society--particularly those of the lower classes--through the eyes of a well-educated and intelligent gentleman of the time.</p><p><p><b>John Wesley</b> (1703-1791) was a Anglican cleric and theologian who helped found the Methodist movement with his brother, Charles Wesley, when he began open-air preaching in the manner of George Whitefield.

Farnsworth, age 14, dreamed of trapping light in an empty jar and transmitting it, one line at a time, on a magnetically deflected beam of electrons. <p>Philo Farnsworth was a self-educated farm boy from Rigby, Idaho, when he first sketched his idea for electronic television on a blackboard for his high school science teacher. Six years later, while competitors still struggled with mechanical television systems, Farnsworth successfully demonstrated his invention. He was 21. </p><p>In 1930, Farnsworth was awarded the fundamental patents for modern television. He spent the next decade perfecting his invention, fighting off challenges to his patents by the giant Radio Corporation of America and defending his vision against his own shortsighted investors who did not share his larger dream of scientific independence. </p><p>The Boy Who Invented Television traces Farnsworth&#x2019;s "guided tour" of discovery, describing the observations he made in the course of developing his initial invention, and revealing how his unique insights brought him to the threshold of what might have been an even greater discovery&#x2014;clean, safe, and unlimited energy from controlled nuclear fusion.</p></p><p>Paul Schatzkin has been researching and telling the story of television&#x2019;s forgotten inventor for more than 25 years. He first encountered the subject while serving as a videotape editor on the ABC-TV comedy series "Barney Miller," for which he received an Emmy Award nomination.At the tender age of 14 and with very little previous knowledge of electronics, Philo T. Farnsworth brought together the building blocks for the television medium, which turned 75 on September 7. Schatzkin, a Farnsworth scholar, focuses on the boy genius's life story, showing us who and what influenced him. Drawing on 20 years of research (including interviews with Farnsworth's family and confidants), he details the funding of various television experiments, patent protection efforts, and technological developments. This joins a number of other recent biographies on Farnsworth, most notably Evan Schwartz's The Last Lone Inventor: A Tale of Genius, Deceit, and the Birth of Television, which focuses on his battle with David Sarnoff over the organization of television, and Donald Godfrey's more general Philo T. Farnsworth: The Father of Television. On its own, Schatzkin's book is a great biography of a gifted inventor and of value to anyone seeking an accessible tour of Farnsworth's life and challenges.

It&#39;s a relief to turn to the poems themselves and once more be jolted by their strange beauty, hard-wrought originality, and acetylene anger. &#34;It is a heart, / This holocaust I walk in, / O golden child the world will kill and eat.&#34; While the juvenilia and poems written before 1960 that Ted Hughes has included here prefigure Plath&#39;s later obsessions, they also enable us to witness her turn from thesaurus-heavy verse to stripped-down art as they gather power through raw simplicity. &#34;The blood jet is poetry. / There is no stopping it,&#34; she declares in &#34;Kindness.&#34;Sylvia Plath (1932-1963) was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and studied at Smith College.

It was destroyed by the Nazis in 1933. This episode in history prompted Heike Bauer to ask, Is violence an intrinsic part of modern queer culture? <i>The Hirschfeld Archives</i> answers this critical question by examining the violence that shaped queer existence in the first part of the twentieth century. </p> <p>Hirschfeld himself escaped the Nazis, and many of his papers and publications survived. Bauer examines his accounts of same-sex life from published and unpublished writings, as well as books, articles, diaries, films, photographs and other visual materials, to scrutinize how violence-including persecution, death and suicide-shaped the development of homosexual rights and political activism. </p> <p><i>The Hirschfeld Archives</i> brings these fragments of queer experience together to reveal many unknown and interesting accounts of LGBTQ life in the early twentieth century, but also to illuminate the fact that homosexual rights politics were haunted from the beginning by racism, colonial brutality, and gender violence.</p></p><p><p><i>Examines the violence of queer existence in the first part of the twentieth century</i></p>Heike Bauer is a Senior Lecturer in English and Gender Studies at Birkbeck College, University of London.

Tracy Hogg, a neonatal nurse, teacher, and mother of two, uses these techniques to good effect in <i>Secrets of the Baby Whisperer</i>. Focusing on newborns and their parents, her simple programs are a blend of intelligent intuition and methods based on years of experience. The first half of the book is devoted to E.A.S.Y--her name for creating a structured daily routine for you and your baby that makes the most of your baby's awake times and also leaves time just for you. These concepts aren't designed to force your bundle of joy into not following her body's needs, but rather to create a feasible middle ground between total rigidity and on-demand food and sleep (and no time for mom to shower). If it still strikes you as too regimented, keep reading. The author makes room for differences in personal style and includes short quizzes to determine whether you're a "planner" or a "winger", and what level of daily structure you are likely to find helpful. In the same chapter, she identifies five general temperaments of infants, how to get an accurate feel for yours, and what methods of care are likely to be the most effective for his temperament. Her statement that babies prefer routine is backed up by research from the University of Denver. While most of the book relies on anecdotes to get the points across, Hogg does find room to back up some of her statements with quotes from various researchers and institutions. Included at the end of the book are assurances that E.A.S.Y. can be followed even with a colicky baby or one who's been ruling the roost for the first few months. Frustrated parents might like to read the last page first: "all the baby-whispering advice in the world is useless unless you're having a good time being a parent" is an excellent reminder to enjoy this time with all of its ups and downs. <i>--Jill Lightner</i>"TRACY HOGG HAS GIVEN PARENTS A GREAT GIFT-the ability to develop early insight into their child's temperament."<br>"-Los Angeles Family <br>When Tracy Hogg's "Secrets of the Baby Whisperer was first published, it soared onto bestseller lists across the country. Parents everywhere became "whisperers" to their newborns, amazed that they could actually communicate with their baby within weeks of their child's birth. Tracy gave parents what for some amounted to a miracle: the ability to understand their baby's every coo and cry so that they could tell immediately if the baby was hungry, tired, in real distress, or just in need of a little TLC. Tracy also dispelled the insidious myth that parents must go sleepless for the first year of a baby's life-because a happy baby sleeps through the night. Now you too can benefit from Tracy's more than twenty years' experience. In this groundbreaking book, she shares simple, accessible programs in which you will learn: <br>- E.A.S.Y.-how to get baby to eat, play, and sleep on a schedule that will make every member of the household's life easier and happier.<br>- S.L.O.W.-how to interpret what your baby is trying to tell you (so you don't try to feed him when he really wants a nap).<br>- How to identify which type of baby yours is-Angel, Textbook, Touchy, Spirited, or Grumpy-and then learn the best way to interact with that type.<br>- Tracy's Three Day Magic-how to change any and all bad habits (yours and the baby's) in just three days. <br>At the heart of Tracy's simple but profound message: treat the baby as you would like to be treated yourself. Reassuring, down-to-earth, and often flying in the face of conventional wisdom, "Secrets of the BabyWhisperer promises parents not only a healthier, happier baby but a more relaxed and happy household as well.</p><h2>Making &amp; Enjoying Telescopes: 6 Complete Projects &amp; A Stargazer's Guide</h2><p>Provides basic information for the backyard astronomer, offers activity ideas, and gives construction details for six telescopes</p><p>Ian Wilson was born in London in 1941 and educated at Emanuel School, Wandsworth, and Magdalene College, Oxford, where he graduated in History in 1963.

Following his studies at the University of Vienna, he was highly regarded as a tutor among aristocratic families. The success of his first story "The Condor" in 1840 inaugurated a steady writing career. He was especially notable for the vivid natural landscapes depicted in his writing, and has long been popular in the German-speaking world, while almost entirely unknown to English readers. He died in 1868 of self-inflicted wounds."Stifter, whose texts, on this evidence, possessed the same discursive and cumulative power as the writings of the late WG Sebald." -<b><i>&nbsp;The Observer</i></b></p><h2>Lords of the Atlas: The Rise and Fall of the House of Glaoua, 1893-1956</h2><p>A dramatic history of intrigue and action in Morocco during the rise and spectacular fall of the House of Glaoua; with color photographs.<br></p><p>Lords of the Atlas is a classic story of Morocco and the rise and spectacular fall of the House of Glaoua. Madini and T'hami El Glaoui, sons of a Moroccan Caid by an Ethiopian concubine, rose meteorically to power in the almost medieval state of Morocco at the end of the nineteenth Century. This is the epic story of the more than fifty years in which they governed the country in barbaric, ostentatious splendor, until their spectacular downfall in 1956. Out of the intriguing and dramatic lives of Madair and T'hami, Gavin Maxwell has fashioned an epic story set against the superb background of Marrakesh and the pinnacled castles of the High Atlas, still magnificent as crumbling ruins. A dramatic history of intrigue, action, and exotic places, and illustrated with over one hundred color illustrations and photographs, Lords of the Atlas is a stunning look at the rise and fall of one of the twentieth century's most fascinating rulers. (8 X 9 3/4, 276 pages, color photos, b&amp;w photos, map, illustrations)<br>Gavin Maxwell was the author of over half a dozen books during his life, including the classic Ring of Bright Waters and Harpoon Venture. He died in 1969.</p><h2>The Hippies and American Values</h2><p>"The sixties' political agenda may have been ground down to ambiguity at best, but moral and spiritual America will never again be quite what it was before the coming of the hippies, and Miller has shown how and why."&#x2014;Robert S. Ellwood, University of Southern California<br>The hippies of the late 1960s were cultural dissenters who, among other things, advocated drastic rethinking of certain traditional American values and standards.&nbsp; In this lucid, lively survey, Timothy Miller traces the movement's ethical innovations and analyzes the impact of its ideas on subsequent American culture.<br><br>Dedicated to such tenets as the primacy of love, trust in intuition and direct experience, the rejection of meaningless work, and a disdain for money and materialism, the hippies advocated dropping out of the dominant culture, and proposed new and more permissive ethics in several areas.&nbsp; They argued that, while some drugs were indeed harmful, others provided useful insights and experiences and therefore should be freely available and widely used.&nbsp; They endorsed a liberal ethics of sex, in which no sexual act between or among consenting adults would be banned.&nbsp; They developed an ethics of rock-and-roll music, arguing that rock was the language of a generation and that it helped promote new ways of thinking and living.&nbsp; They also revived the venerable American tradition of communal living.<br>In contrast to most available literature on the 1960s, this book deals with the cultural revolutionaries and not the political radicals of the New Left.&nbsp; And instead of relying on later interviews with persons who were active in the 1960s, Miller draws mainly on underground newspapers of the day, the most important literary creation of the hippies themselves.&nbsp; The result is a historical encounter of rare immediacy.<br><br>Timothy Miller is assistant professor of religious studies at the University of Kansas.<br></p><p>Timothy Miller is assistant professor of religious studies at the University of Kansas.The 1960s counterculture movement and its embraced ethical values are the subject of this very readable work. Miller (religious studies, Univ. of Kansas) used the so-called "underground" newspapers of that era as his primary research tool. The result is a thorough look at what the hippies and their allies sought to fundamentally change in the then-entrenched mainstream of American values. There were many bones of contention, but most of what Miller terms "cultural opposition" fall into four main categories: drugs, sex, rock music, and the sense of community. After introducing these areas in their 1960s embodiment, he surveys their effect on the 1990s. The topics are covered in a lively and informative style, though the movement's detractors may find the author a bit too sympathetic to the countercultural movement in his conclusions. Nevertheless, this valuable scholarly effort also makes for interesting pleasure reading.<br><i>- David M.

Summary; At Runnymede, on the banks of the River Thames, on 15 June 1215, the seal of King John was attached to the Magna Carta, and peace descended upon the land. Or that&#39;s what successive generations have believed. But is it true? And have we been persuaded (or persuaded ourselves) that the events of 15 June 1215 not only ended a civil war between the king and the barons but - as if by magic - established a British constitution beloved and copied throughout the world? Often viewed as a victory for the people over the monarchy and a cornerstone of democracy, the true significance of Magna Carta is misunderstood and misrepresented. In Magna Carta: The True Story Behind the Charter, David Starkey paints a vivid portrait of the years 1215-1225, ten revolutionary years of huge significance that produced not one but four charters. Peopled by colourful historical figures - John, the boy-king Henry, Pope Innocent III, Archbishop Stephen Langton, William Marshal - Starkey tells a story of treachery and idealism, politics and peace-making that is surprising and enthralling.

He is a winner of the Norton Medlicott Medal for Services to History, and of the WH Smith Prize.

Starkey was made a CBE in 2007 and lives in London.It&#39;s fun to read and I recommend it to everyone. -- Helena Kennedy * BBC Radio 4 Today Programme * A perceptive historian with a populist&#39;s ability to communicate... admirable for its lucidity and brevity; this book is all that most people will need to know about the epochal charter and its legacy. Starkey also has the courage and imagination to interpret Magna Carta in a manner that has profound meaning for the world of today. -- Gerard DeGroot * The Times * This is a soaring account of the months that transformed a messy feudal squabble into Magna Carta, a document of transcendent historical importance in the English-speaking world. It is a reminder that, when Starkey flexes his historical muscles, he is a mighty impressive scholar. And his crisp storytelling, based around short chapters and rolling rhetoric, is extremely entertaining. -- Dan Jones * Mail on Sunday *</p><h2>The Collected Prose: 1948-1998</h2><p><p>&#x201c;One of the finest and most original writers...and one of the greatest Polish writers of [the 20th] century.

Intimate and grand, learned and engaging, Michael Levey's <i>Florence</i> renders the city in all of its madness and magnificence. </p></p><p>The usual tourist group&#39;s stay in Florence begins with the Duomo, runs through the paintings in the Uffizi, includes a visit to Michaelangelo&#39;s &#34;David&#34; and ends with a parade through a handful of churches. But the visitor who first reads Sir Michael Levey&#39;s portrait of the city will find rewards off that well-worn track. The city, a self-styled &#34;new Athens&#34; supported a wealth of artists, sculptors, humanists, and scholars, not to mention more than its share of wealthy individuals, who taken together, helped turn Florence into one of the world&#39;s great provincial outposts. Layering telling details, little-known facts and carefully explained social and intellectual history, Levey weaves a dense tale of this charming city, from the Middle Ages to the Quattrocento, through the Renaissance and on up to the early years of this century.<b>Michael Levey</b> was Director of the National Gallery, London, from 1973 to 1986.

Smooth-talking, irresistible Tyrone the swagger in his step, the sexy drawl, the poetry and rhythm in his essence the militant revolutionary of the 1960s evolved into the pimp/thug of the hip-hop era. Tyrone is the Black man seen through the media lens, through stereotype, through the eyes of Black women. He&#x2019;s "Talk Show Tyrone," all muscle and defiance, an archetype converted to a hit single.&#x201d;<br>In<i> Deconstructing Tyrone,</i> the authors, journalists Natalie Y. Moore and Natalie Hopkinson, examine Black masculinity from a variety of perspectives, looking not for consensus but for insight. With chapters on Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, on the complicated relationship between women and hip-hop, on babydaddies, on gay Black men on and off the down low, on strippers and their fathers, on Black men in the office, at school, and in jail,<i> Deconstructing Tyrone</i> presents a multifaceted picture of American Black men now.</p><p>Natalie Y. Moore writes for numerous news outlets including the Chicago Tribune, Seattle Times, Detroit Metro-Times, Bitch, alternet.org and bet.com. She lives in Chicago. Natalie Hopkinson is a staff writer for the Washington Post and a professor of journalism at the University of Maryland. She lives in Washington, D.C.Reviewed by Evelyn C. White <br>In 1997, singer Erykah Badu released "Tyrone," in which she bemoans a lover who can't function without his posse, including a hanger-on she dubs "Tyrone." Fed up with her man, she croons, "I think ya better call Tyrone, And tell him come on, help you get your [stuff]." <p> Tyrone is "a name that has come to speak to a unique form of black male identity," write Natalie Hopkinson and Natalie Y. Moore in Deconstructing Tyrone, "one flavored with a distinctly postsoul aesthetic. Simply put: Tyrone is our boy." Taking that name as their guide for this intriguing book, Hopkinson (a Washington Post reporter) and Moore (a Chicago journalist and teacher) explore the world of black men who, like the authors, are members of the hip-hop generation. </p><p> Black men who exhibit "Tyroninity," the authors' term for a cavalier disregard for convention, are often disparaged as sidekicks to their more forceful male peers. Yet in their attention to everyday issues of survival, such men play an important role in the black community. Disdainful of the integrationist gains of the civil rights movement, Tyrones favor entrepreneurial endeavors over establishment jobs. Hopkinson and Moore compare that attitude with the laments of their own fathers, outwardly successful beneficiaries of the battles for racial equality who hated "working for The Man. . . . We heard axioms such as: There is nothing. Harder. In this world. Than being a black man in corporate America. Own your own business. Write your own ticket. . . . Our peers have listened."</p><p> The authors offer Kwame Kilpatrick as an example of someone who works within the system, albeit with his own flair. A former middle school teacher and a law school graduate, Kilpatrick grew up in a politically prominent family. When he ran for mayor of Detroit in 2001 at 31, he stopped wearing a large diamond stud in his ear on the advice of pollsters. When he won, he restored the stud, signaling his intent to rule the roost as mayor. Kilpatrick's administration has bedazzled (after-school programs flourish) and bedeviled (allegations of cronyism abound) Detroit: "Like hip-hop, he's flashy, fresh, a finger-to-the-establishment. Like hip-hop, he is, at his worst, arrogant, unfocused, and undisciplined." </p><p>Washington Wizards star Etan Thomas's outspokenness also qualifies him as a Tyrone. At a 2005 rally against the Iraq War, he announced to a roaring crowd, "I wanna get one of those big yellow buses with no air-conditioning and no seat belts. Round up Bill O'Reilly, Pat Buchanan and any other right-wing, conservative Republicans I can think of, and take them on a trip to the hood." Thomas's admiration of controversial groups such as the Black Muslims earned him an "our boy" stamp of approval from the authors. "I have so much respect for the Nation of Islam," Thomas told them in an interview. "They encourage the black man to walk upright."</p><p> But there's a downside to Tyroninity. Hopkinson and Moore note the multitudes of "Tyrones" who've barraged the world with degrading portraits of black women, citing specifically the rapper Nelly's infamous video in which he swipes a credit card between a woman's buttocks. "So what is the self-respecting black woman to do?" they ask. "Often the most thugged-out rappers turn to sharp, educated women to market their images. Scores of black women coordinate media interviews, design publicity campaigns . . . and style video shoots." Such women are empathetic to the longing among rappers for wealth and fame -- by any means necessary, the authors explain. But readers are likely to be disappointed by their final limp take on hip-hop misogyny: "Unfortunately, there is no easy resolution to a crisis that has been decades in the making."</p><p> Deconstructing Tyrone meets The Autobiography of Malcolm X in the authors' riveting account of Kofi "Debo" Ajabu, who was reared in black grassroots traditions. A gifted child of activist parents, Ajabu, at age 21, was convicted for his alleged part in a gruesome murder and is now serving a 180-year prison term. His parents had "tried to insulate Debo . . . from the toxic racial climate by enveloping [him] in a community of like-minded souls, committed to the liberation struggle of black people. . . . [They] went to black cultural events, boycotted products doing business with South Africa, and taught their children Swahili." Still, Ajabu embraced the gangster lifestyle. "You wouldn't believe how many middle-class gangbangers there are," he tells the authors. "It's like . . . we gotta prove some[thing]."</p><p> Deconstructing Tyrone achieves a deep poignancy when the authors describe Ajabu's response to his plight. "This is not life," he insists from his prison cell. "I will never accept this. . . . I was brought up to be free." Black men of the hip-hop generation are stepping to a different beat. But as the authors reveal, the path to freedom remains fraught with personal and societal peril. <br>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

When the Jesuits were expelled from the Venetian dominion a few years later, religious censorship was virtually eliminated. The result was a remarkable era of cultural innovation that promoted free inquiry in the face of philosophical and theological orthodoxy, advocated libertine morals, critiqued the tyranny of aristocratic fathers over their daughters, and expanded the theatrical potential of grand opera.</p><p>In Padua a faction of university faculty, including Galileo Galilei and the philosopher Cesare Cremonini, pursued an open and free inquiry into astronomy and philosophy. In Venice some of Cremonini's students founded the Accademia degli Incogniti (Academy of the Unknowns), one of whose most notorious members was the brilliant polemicist Ferrante Pallavicino. </p><p>The execution of Pallavicino for his writings attacking Pope Urban VIII silenced the more outrageous members of the Incogniti, who soon turned to writing libretti for operas. The final phase of the Venetian culture wars pitted commercial opera, with its female performers and racy plot lines, against the decorous model of Jesuit theater. The libertine inclinations of the Incogniti suffuse many of the operas written in the 1640s, especially Monteverdi's masterpiece, L'Incoronazione di Poppea.</p><p>Edward Muir's exploration of an earlier age of anxiety reveals the distinguished past of today's culture wars, including debates about the place of women in society, the clash between science and faith, and the power of the arts to stir emotions.</p></p><p>Edward Muir is Clarence L. Ver Steeg Professor in the Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University.&#x201c;Finding the roots of opera in the history of science is a task that would daunt even a polymath of Renaissance stature. Yet in <i>The Culture Wars of the Late Renaissance</i>, Edward Muir plausibly explains how the skepticism taught by a professor at the University of Padua in the early 17th century fostered a musical revolution in neighboring Venice--and much else besides.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Francis X.

Soon after his birth in Czechoslovakia in 1947, his family migrated to the Belgian Congo (now Zaire). Early experiences as a hunter inspired Gersi's lust for adventuring into the world's uncharted territories: islands in the Sulu Archipelago, Borneo, etc. He has lived with such tribes as the head hunters of Borneo (who made him a member) and shared their sometimes dreadful customs, such as eating dogs boiled alive. The explorer's career will inform and absorb those who can tolerate the daunting parts of the book and Gersi's self-aggrandizing posture.

No wonder 14-year-old Georgia Nicolson laments, "Honestly, what is the point?" A Bridget Jones for the younger set, Georgia records the momentous events of her life--and they are all momentous--in her diary, which serves as a truly hilarious account of what it means to be a modern girl on the cusp of womanhood. No matter that her particular story takes place in England, the account of her experiences rings true across the ocean (and besides, "Georgia's Glossary" swiftly eradicates any language barriers). <p> The author, Louise Rennison, is a British comedy writer and it shows. Whether Georgia is dealing with wearing a bra ("OK, it's a bit on the loose side and does ride up round my neck if I run for the bus"), pondering kissing and how to know which way to turn your head ("You don't want to be bobbing around like pigeons for hours"), or managing the results of an overzealous eyebrow-plucking episode ("Obviously, now I have to stay in forever"), she always cracks us up. Georgia struggles with the myriad issues facing teen girls--boys, of course being at the forefront--but she does it with such humor and honesty it almost seems like a good time. This refreshingly funny book is ripe for a sequel, which readers will await in droves.

Tired of his aristocratic family constantly pressuring him to get married, he determines to run away after meeting the delightful, unconventional heroine Penelope Creed. Penelope literally falls into his life late one night as she hangs from the window of her aunt&#39;s house she too attempting to escape the pressures of forced marriage. The two allies become embroiled in a series hilarious madcap adventures as they cross-dress, run into escaped criminals, have a case of mistaken identity and save people from their own dramatics. Little do they predict their feelings for one another blossoming into romance.</p><p>The late Georgette Heyer was a very private woman. Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>The company, ushered by a disapproving butler into the yellow saloon of Sir Richard Wyndham's house in St James's Square, comprised two ladies and one reluctant gentleman. The gentleman, who was not much above thirty years of age, but sadly inclined to fat, seemed to feel the butler's disapproval, for upon that dignified individual's informing the elder of the two ladies that Sir Richard was not at home, he cast a deprecating glance at him, not in the least the glance of a peer of the realm upon a menial, but an age-old look of one helpless man to another, and said in a pleading tone: &#x2018;Well, then, don't you think, Lady Wyndham ? Louisa, hadn't we better ? I mean, no use going in, my love, is there?'</p> <p>Neither his wife nor his mother-in-law paid any attention to this craven speech. &#x2018;If my brother is gone out, we will await his return,' said Louisa briskly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Your poor Papa was always out when one wanted him,' complained Lady Wyndham. &#x2018;It is very affecting to me to see Richard growing every day more like him.'</p> <p>Her fading accents were so lachrymose that it seemed probable that she would dissolve into tears upon her son's doorstep. George, Lord Trevor, was uneasily aware of a handkerchief, clutched in one thin, gloved hand, and put forward no further objection to entering the house in the wake of the two ladies.</p> <p>Declining all offers of refreshment, Lady Trevor escorted her parent into the Yellow Saloon, settled her comfortably upon a satin sofa, and announced her intention of remaining in St James's Square all day, if need be. George, with a very clear idea, born of sympathy, of what would be his brother-in-law's emotions upon returning to his residence to find a family deputation in possession of it, said unhappily: &#x2018;You know, I don't think we should, really I don't! I don't like it above half. I wish you would drop this notion you've taken into your heads.'</p> <p>His wife, who was engaged in stripping off her lavender-kid gloves, threw him a look of indulgent contempt. &#x2018;My dear George, if you are afraid of Richard, let me assure you that I am not.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Afraid of him! No, indeed! But I wish you will consider that a man of nine-and-twenty won't relish having his affairs meddled with. Besides, he will very likely wonder what the deuce it has to do with me, and I'm sure I can't tell him! I wish I had not come.'</p> <p>Louisa ignored this remark, considering it unworthy of being replied to, which indeed it was, since she ruled her lord with a rod of iron. She was a handsome woman, with a great deal of decision in her face, and a leavening gleam of humour. She was dressed, not perhaps in the height of fashion, which decreed that summer gauzes must reveal every charm of a lady's body, but with great elegance and propriety. Since she had a very good figure, the prevailing mode for high-waisted dresses, with low-cut bodices, and tiny puff-sleeves, became her very well: much better, in fact, than skin-tight pantaloons, and a long-tailed coat became her husband.</p> <p>Fashion was not kind to George. He looked his best in buckskin breeches and top-boots, but he was unfortunately addicted to dandyism, and pained his friends and relatives by adopting every extravagance of dress, spending as much time over the arrangement of his cravat as Mr Brummell himself, and squeezing his girth into tight stays which had a way of creaking whenever he moved unwarily.</p> <p>The third member of the party, reclining limply on the satin sofa, was a lady with quite as much determination as her daughter, and a far more subtle way of getting her wishes attended to. A widow of ten years' standing, Lady Wyndham enjoyed the frailest health. The merest hint of opposition was too much for the delicate state of her nerves; and anyone, observing her handkerchief, her vinaigrette, and the hartshorn which she usually kept by her, would have had to be stupid indeed to have failed to appreciate their sinister message. In youth, she had been a beauty; in middle age, everything about her seemed to have faded: hair, cheeks, eyes, and even her voice, which was plaintive, and so gentle that it was a wonder it ever made itself heard. Like her daughter, Lady Wyndham had excellent taste in dress, and since she was fortunate enough to possess a very ample jointure she was able to indulge her liking for the most expensive fal-lals of fashion without in any way curtailing her other expenses. This did not prevent her from thinking herself very badly off, but she was able to enjoy many laments over her straitened circumstances without feeling the least real pinch of poverty, and to win the sympathy of her acquaintances by dwelling sadly on the injustice of her late husband's will, which had placed his only son in the sole possession of his immense fortune. The jointure, her friends deduced hazily, was the veriest pittance.</p> <p>Lady Wyndham, who lived in a charming house in Clarges Street, could never enter the mansion in St James's Square without suffering a pang. It was not, as might have been supposed from the look of pain she always cast upon it, a family domicile, but had been acquired by her son only a couple of years before. During Sir Edward's lifetime, the family had lived in a much larger, and most inconvenient house in Grosvenor Square. Upon Sir Richard's announcement that he proposed to set up an establishment of his own, this had been given up, so that Lady Wyndham had been able ever since to mourn its loss without being obliged to suffer any longer its inconveniences. But however much she might like her own house in Clarges Street it was not to be supposed that she could bear with equanimity her son's inhabiting a far larger house in St James's Square; and when every other source of grievance failed her, she always came back to that, and said, as she said now, in an ill-used voice: &#x2018;I cannot conceive what he should want with a house like this!'</p> <p>Louisa, who had a very good house of her own, besides an estate in Berkshire, did not in the least grudge her brother his mansion. She replied: &#x2018;It doesn't signify, Mama. Except that he must have been thinking of marriage when he bought it. Would you not say so, George?'</p> <p>George was flattered at being thus appealed to, but he was an honest, painstaking person, and he could not bring himself to say that he thought Richard had had any thought of marriage in his head, either when he had bought the house, or at any other time.</p> <p>Louisa was displeased. &#x2018;Well!' she said, looking resolute, &#x2018;he must be brought to think of marriage!'</p> <p>Lady Wyndham lowered her smelling-salts to interpolate: &#x2018;Heaven knows I would never urge my boy to do anything distasteful, but it has been an understood thing for years that he and Melissa Brandon would seal the long friendship between our families with the Nuptial Tie!'</p> <p>George goggled at her, and wished himself otherwhere.</p> <p>&#x2018;If he doesn't wish to marry Melissa, I'm sure I should be the last person to press her claim,' said Louisa. &#x2018;But it is high time that he married someone, and if he has no other suitable young female in his eye, Melissa it must be.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I do not know how to face Lord Saar,' bemoaned Lady Wyndham, raising the vinaigrette to her nose again. &#x2018;Or poor dear Emily, with three girls besides Melissa to dispose of, and none of them more than passable. Sophia has spots, too.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I do not consider Augusta hopeless,' said Louisa fairly. &#x2018;Amelia, too, may improve.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Squints!' said George.</p> <p>&#x2018;A slight cast in one eye,' corrected Louisa. &#x2018;However, we are not concerned with that. Melissa is an extremely handsome creature. No one can deny that!'</p> <p>&#x2018;And such a desirable connection!' sighed Lady Wyndham. &#x2018;Quite one of the best families!'</p> <p>&#x2018;They tell me Saar won't last another five years, not at the rate he's going now,' said George. &#x2018;Everything mortgaged up to the hilt, and Saar drinking himself into his grave! They say his father did the same.'</p> <p>Both ladies regarded him with disfavour. &#x2018;I hope, George, you do not mean to imply that Melissa is addicted to the bottle?' said his wife.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh no, no! Lord, no, I never thought of such a thing! I'm sure she's an excellent young woman. But this I will say, Louisa: I don't blame Richard if he don't want her!' said George defiantly. &#x2018;Myself, I'd as soon marry a statue!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I must say,' conceded Louisa, &#x2018;she is a trifle cold, perhaps. But it is a very delicate position for her, you'll allow. It has been understood since both were children that she and Richard would make a match of it, and she knows that as well as we do. And here is Richard, behaving in the most odious way! I am out of all patience with him!'</p> <p>George rather liked his brother-in-law, but he knew that it would be foolhardy to defend him, so he held his peace. Lady Wyndham took up the tale of woe. &#x2018;Heaven forbid that I should force my only son to a disagreeable marriage, but I live in hourly dread of his bringing home some dreadful, low-born creature on his arm, and expecting me to welcome her!'</p> <p>A vision of his brother-in-law crossed George's mind's eye. He said doubtfully: &#x2018;Really, you know, I don't think he'll do that, ma'am.'</p> <p>&#x2018;George is quite right,' announced Louisa. &#x2018;I should think the better of Richard if he did. It quite shocks me to see him so impervious to every feminine charm! It is a great piece of nonsense for him to dislike the opposite sex, but one thing is certain: dislike females he may, but he owes a duty to the name, and marry he must! I am sure I have been at pains to introduce him to every eligible young woman in town, for I am by no means set on his marrying Melissa Brandon. Well! He would not look twice at any of them, so if that is the mind he is in, Melissa will suit him very well.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Richard thinks they all want him for his money,' ventured George.</p> <p>&#x2018;I dare say they may. What has that to say to anything, pray? I imagine you do not mean to tell me that Richard is romantic!'</p> <p>No, George was forced to admit that Richard was not romantic.</p> <p>&#x2018;If I live to see him suitably married, I can die content!' said Lady Wyndham, who had every expectation of living for another thirty years. &#x2018;His present course fills my poor mother's heart with foreboding!'</p> <p>Loyalty forced George to expostulate. &#x2018;No, really, ma'am! Really, I say! There's no harm in Richard, not the least in the world, 'pon my honour!'</p> <p>&#x2018;He puts me out of all patience!' said Louisa. &#x2018;I love him dearly, but I despise him with all my heart! Yes, I do, and I do not care who hears me say so! He cares for nothing but the set of his cravat, the polish on his boots, and the blending of his snuff!'</p> <p>&#x2018;His horses!' begged George unhappily.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, his horses! Very well! Let us admit him to be a famous whip! He beat Sir John Lade in their race to Brighton! A fine achievement indeed!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Very handy with his fives!' gasped George, sinking but game.</p> <p>&#x2018;You may admire a man for frequenting Jackson's Saloon, and Cribb's Parlour! I do not!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, my love,' George said. &#x2018;No, indeed, my love!'</p> <p>&#x2018;And I make no doubt you see nothing reprehensible in his addiction to the gaming-table! But I had it on the most excellent authority that he dropped three thousand pounds at one sitting at Almack's!'</p> <p>Lady Wyndham moaned, and dabbed at her eyes. &#x2018;Oh, do not say so!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, but he's so devilish wealthy it can't signify!' said George.</p> <p>&#x2018;Marriage,' said Louisa, &#x2018;will put a stop to such fripperies.'</p> <p>The depressing picture this dictum conjured up reduced George to silence. Lady Wyndham said, in a voice dark with mystery: &#x2018;Only a mother could appreciate my anxieties. He is at a dangerous age, and I live from day to day in dread of what he may do!'</p> <p>George opened his mouth, encountered a look from his wife, shut it again, and tugged unhappily at his cravat.</p> <p>The door opened; a Corinthian stood upon the threshold, cynically observing his relatives. &#x2018;A thousand apologies,' said the Corinthian, bored but polite. &#x2018;Your very obedient servant, ma'am. Louisa, yours! My poor George! Ah was I expecting you?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Apparently not!' retorted Louisa, bristling.</p> <p>&#x2018;No, you weren't. I mean, they took it into their heads I couldn't stop them!' said George heroically.</p> <p>&#x2018;I thought I was not,' said the Corinthian, closing the door, and advancing into the room. &#x2018;But my memory, you know, my lamentable memory!'</p> <p>George, running an experienced eye over his brother-in-law, felt his soul stir. &#x2018;B'gad, Richard, I like that! That's a devilish well-cut coat, 'pon my honour, it is! Who made it?'</p> <p>Sir Richard lifted an arm, and glanced at his cuff. &#x2018;Weston, George, only Weston.'</p> <p>&#x2018;George!' said Louisa awfully.</p> <p>Sir Richard smiled faintly, and crossed the room to his mother's side. She held out her hand to him, and he bowed over it with languid grace, just brushing it with his lips. &#x2018;A thousand apologies, ma'am!' he repeated. &#x2018;I trust my people have looked after you er all of you?' His lazy glance swept the room. &#x2018;Dear me!' he said. &#x2018;George, you are near to it: oblige me, my dear fellow, by pulling the bell!'</p> <p>&#x2018;We do not need any refreshment, I thank you, Richard,' said Louisa.</p> <p>The faint, sweet smile silenced her as none of her husband's expostulations had ever done. &#x2018;My dear Louisa, you mistake I assure you, you mistake! George is in the most urgent need of er stimulant. Yes, Jeffries, I rang. The Madeira oh, ah! and some ratafia, Jeffries, if you please!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Richard, that's the best Waterfall I've ever seen!' exclaimed George, his admiring gaze fixed on the intricate arrangement of the Corinthian's cravat.</p> <p>&#x2018;You flatter me, George; I fear you flatter me.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Pshaw!' snapped Louisa.</p> <p>&#x2018;Precisely, my dear Louisa,' agreed Sir Richard amiably. </p> <p>&#x2018;Do not try to provoke me, Richard!' said Louisa, on a warning note. &#x2018;I will allow your appearance to be everything that it should be admirable, I am sure!'</p> <p>&#x2018;One does one's poor best,' murmured Sir Richard.</p> <p>Her bosom swelled. &#x2018;Richard, I could hit you!' she declared.</p> <p>The smile grew, allowing her a glimpse of excellent white teeth. &#x2018;I don't think you could, my dear.'</p> <p>George so far forgot himself as to laugh. A quelling glance was directed upon him. &#x2018;George, be quiet!' said Louisa.</p> <p>&#x2018;I must say,' conceded Lady Wyndham, whose maternal pride could not quite be overborne, &#x2018;there is no one, except Mr Brummell, of course, who looks as well as you do, Richard.'</p> <p>He bowed, but he did not seem to be unduly elated by this encomium. Possibly he took it as his due. He was a very notable Corinthian. From his Wind-swept hair (most difficult of all styles to achieve), to the toes of his gleaming Hessians, he might have posed as an advertisement for the Man of Fashion. His fine shoulders set off a coat of superfine cloth to perfection; his cravat, which had excited George's admiration, had been arranged by the hands of a master; his waistcoat was chosen with a nice eye; his biscuit-coloured pantaloons showed not one crease; and his Hessians with their jaunty gold tassels, had not only been made for him by Hoby, but were polished, George suspected, with a blacking mixed with champagne. A quizzing-glass on a black ribbon hung round his neck; a fob at his waist; and in one hand he carried a S�vres snuff-box. His air proclaimed his unutterable boredom, but no tailoring, no amount of studied nonchalance, could conceal the muscle in his thighs, or the strength of his shoulders. Above the starched points of his shirt-collar, a weary, handsome face showed its owner's disillusionment. Heavy lids drooped over grey eyes which were intelligent enough, but only to observe the vanities of the world; the smile which just touched that resolute mouth seem...</p></p><h2>The Last Battle (Chronicles/Narnia Celebratn ed)</h2><p>This delightful book is a celebration of the first edition of The Last Battle, with the original design and illustrations.

The story details the mental journey of an unnamed narrator who is transported not only to other worlds but also other galaxies and parallel universes, until he eventually becomes part of the "cosmic mind." First published in 1937, Olaf Stapledon's descriptions of alien life are a political commentary on human life in the turbulent inter-war years. The book challenges preconceived notions of intelligence and awareness, and ultimately argues for a broadened perspective that would free us from culturally ingrained thought and our inevitable anthropomorphism.</p> <p>This bold exploration of the cosmos ventures into intelligent star clusters and mingles among alien races for a memorable vision of infinity. Cited as a key influence by science-fiction masters such as Doris Lessing, this classic has left its mark not only in modern literature but also in the fields of social anthropology and philosophy.</p> <p>Olaf Stapledon's 1937 successor to Last and First Men offers another entrancing speculative history of the future. Its narrator, a contemporary Earthman, joins a community of explorers who travel to the farthest reaches of the universe, seeking traces of intelligence. Along the way, they encounter nautiloid water beings, races of hyperspiders and hyperfish, composite group intelligences, plantlike creatures, and other strange life forms. Their dramatic voyage unfolds against a backdrop of life-and-death struggles on a cosmic scale. </p></p><p>5 1/2 x 8 1/2 trim. 3 illus.Olaf Stapledon (1886-1950) served as Lecturer in Psychology and Philosophy at Liverpool University.

Instead of ferocious cannibals, Schneebaum found a regal, loving, gentle people who freely accepted him and initiated him into a way of life no outsider had ever seen before. Adopted into an Asmat family in the village whose people were said to have killed Rockefeller, he crossed the boundaries into another culture and another age, learning secrets no other outsider had been allowed to see before. But it wasn't until Schneebaum met Akatpitsjin, a handsome married man with five children, that he entered the erotic world of the Asmat, when the two became "exchange friends" and lovers, a practice basic to the sexual life of the village. <p>Schneebaum's encounter with the Asmat ultimately became something more intimate and liberating for him than the mere discovery of tribal secrets. He confronted himself. His odyssey is as much the record of a journey into himself as it is a unique and sensitively observed account of a vanishing society, written with a shimmering sensuality that has no equal in the literature of anthropology or self-confession. </p><p>"Exhilarating and unforgettable.

He was the assistant curator of the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress in Irian Jaya from 1973 to 1983. Since then he has served as the curator of a number of exhibitions of Asmat art, and lectured on Asmat culture at universities and museums around the world. Where the Spirits Dwell is the final volume of his autobiographical trilogy, which also includes Keep the River on Your Right and Wild Man.

Should we be outraged that some of those famous scenes in <i>Blue Planet</i> were filmed in a lab? Who are the scientists putting ever-more improbable flavors in our Jelly Belly beans? Welcome to the world of &#x201c;genuine fakes&#x201d;--the curious objects that fall in between things that are real and things that are not. Unsurprisingly, the world is full of genuine fakes that defy simple categorization. Whether or not we think that those things are authentic is a matter of perspective. </p><p>In <i>Genuine Fakes</i>, historian Lydia Pyne explores how the authenticity of eight genuine fakes depends on their unique combinations of history, science and culture. The stories of art forgeries, fake fossils, nature documentaries, synthetic flavors, museum exhibits, Maya codices and Paleolithic replicas shows that genuine fakes are complicated and change over time. Drawing from historical archives, interviews, museum exhibits, science fiction as well as her own research, Pyne brings each genuine fake to life through unexpected and often outrageous stories. </p><p>Can people move past assuming that a diamond grown in a lab is a fake?

She was queen for only nine days, however. Edward&#39;s eldest sister, Mary, soon challenged Jane for the throne, with tragic results. This is the true story of a bright and intelligent young woman who was manipulated and betrayed by the ambitious people who surrounded her.</p><p>I first heard the story of Lady Jane Grey when I was living in London, England, in the 1970&#39;s. I was very moved by it and felt that young people in Canada and elsewhere would also be touched by her fate. During the course of the research and the writing of the novel I became so attached to Jane that when the book was ready to be published I dedicated it to her. I did most of the research at the British Museum, and there I was privileged to hold in my hands and look through the very prayer book that Jane carried to her execution. It is a small, fat book, and opened on its own accord to the page where Jane pressed down hard enough to crack the spine when she wrote her last letter to her father in the margin.The Chief Justic stood up. His voice trembled. "The Lady Jane (Dudley) is hereby condemned to death--to be burned alive or beheaded, as the queen shall please." <p>Jane is only fifteen. For nine days, she was Queen of England.

Motivating yourself to choose the healthiest paths (Parts Four and Five)1WHO ARE YOU WHEN YOU'RE NOT BEING YOURSELF?<i>We are so used to disguising ourselves from others that we end up disguising ourselves from ourselves.</i>--FRAN�OIS DE LA ROUCHEFOUCAULD, DUC DE LA ROUCHEFOUCAULD&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We want to know and be known for our very best. One way we identify this is to look for the best in others. You probably have known rare individuals who seem to craft their lives moment-by-moment with deliberate, positive actions. People like Morrie Schwartz of <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i>, Mitch Albom's book about the seventy-eight-year-old former sociology professor who met his terminal illness with inspiring dignity and grace. How do people like Morrie live exceptional lives? What can we learn from such people about cultivating the exceptional in ourselves?Perhaps you feel at your best when you "follow your bliss," as Joseph Campbell wrote. Who or what within you recognizes your bliss and leads you to it? Pause for a moment and recall a time when you felt deeply content. Perhaps you experienced an epiphany about your life's goals, felt at peace with the world, or intuitively knew the right choice in difficult circumstances. Think of your most intimate relationship or closest friendship, and recall an exceptionally satisfying moment. Perhaps you felt deeply connected, seen, and heard. What was the source of these moments? What made them end? How might you create them more often?The answers on how to cultivate and express the exceptional within you are found to a large extent in how you define yourself. You have the ability to define who you are at any moment. For example, surveys have reported that:� 25 percent of high school students rated themselves in the top 1 percent in leadership ability� 80 percent of drivers rated themselves as better than average� 83 percent of college students thought themselves more generous than other people� 94 percent of university professors ranked themselves better than average at their jobs� 85 percent of people rate their own manners as good or excellent, but only 23 percent give the same marks to others� Individual investors at one conference confidently predicted, on average, that their own retirement savings would be twice the average size of the savings of all other investors in attendanceFlattering self-definitions like these are benign. Self-images exist on a continuum from helpful to harmful. You can view yourself as small or big, dumb or smart, unworthy or worthy, loser or winner. When you define yourself as small, dumb, unworthy, or a loser--even when you do so without awareness and are none of these--your attitudes, emotions, and actions move in accordance with this negative self-view. You can mentally negate years of love or work with a single thought. You can look at a twenty-year marriage and see only what is missing. You can look at a career of overcoming challenges and contributing to others and think, "So what?" Of course, the goodness in your marriage isn't actually lost and your career accomplishments don't actually vanish. But when you feel small, it is as though what you do counts for nothing.The vast array of ways we define ourselves without knowing we're doing so is astounding. A fleeting first impression, when acted upon, sets in motion one course of events and excludes a universe of possible others. A doubt, once you run with it, can dictate your actions and moods. You might take a moment and recall a time when you lost an opportunity, a cherished connection, financial wealth, or happiness because you were behaving in accord with a negative self-image. <i>Simply because of a definition</i>.You've probably seen this happen to loved ones. At times, they may have chosen to quit, even when you knew they could have kept going and succeeded. At other times, they may have chosen to believe in themselves, perhaps with your help, and kept going instead.The irony is that every time you undermine yourself with a negative or inaccurate self-image, you provide evidence of your extraordinarypower. You possess an innate ability to make a convincing case for your worth, or the lack of it. You can foster your dreams as well as neglect them. You can act from self-confidence or be overtaken by worry or guilt. Most important of all, you have the ability to forget who chose one self-image over another.How Self-deception WorksHow can you deceive yourself? It seems a contradiction in terms. One analogy for how self-deception works, offered by philosophy scholar Herbert Fingarette, is to that of falling asleep. Each night you go to bed and eventually sleep overtakes you. When you awaken, you may recall what your last thoughts were prior to falling asleep, or remember your first dream of the night, but it is impossible to remember the <i>exact moment</i> you fell asleep. In this shift from awake to asleep, even though you are the one doing it, sleep descends upon you.Self-deception is similar. Just as we are unaware of what is happening at the moment of falling asleep, we are unaware of the moment we enter into self-deception. Denial, like falling asleep, is experienced as happening <i>to</i> you. If you're aware of falling asleep, you're not yet asleep. When you see your denial at work, you're no longer fully in denial.During sleep, magical events happen. You dream. Your attention is selective. You may stir at the sound of your infant crying, but pay no attention to city sirens or country crickets. Similarly, with self-deception, you see what you want and ignore what's in plain sight. Self-deception lives in a world of alternate realities based on "what-if" or "if-only" premises. Social psychology researchers call this phenomenon <i>counterfactual thinking</i>. It is, quite literally, thinking and perceiving contrary to the facts.Counterfactualizing has benefits, or we wouldn't do it. It can give feelings of mastery, explain mysterious or upsetting events, and soothe or console by allowing you to shift blame or justify your own or others' actions. But your alternate realities may also drop roadblocks in your path.When I began researching this book and told others that I was investigating how and why people subtly mislead themselves and unwittingly sabotage their dreams and plans, the most common response I received was, "Oh, I know someone like that." Self-sabotaging behavioris often easier to see in others than in ourselves. When we view others' self-sabotage or lack of self-awareness, we often rubberneck as if passing a car wreck. It's distressing to see but fascinating to watch. We can't believe what they're doing. We're glad it's not us. We'd shudder to think of ourselves as similarly clueless, inept, or self-destructive. We wonder why they can't see it. We may try to warn them but it often seems as if they can't or won't listen.For example, perhaps you've noticed friends, family, neighbors, or coworkers who:� Repeatedly enter into inappropriate romantic relationships, each time vowing that this one will be different� Spend more time fantasizing about improbable financial windfalls, like winning the lottery, than working� Overbook and overpromise so often that you no longer trust what they say� Work hard to lose twenty pounds through various diets, then quickly regain the lost weight and then some� Dwell on regrets or resentments and can't seem to move on� Endlessly take care of others' needs ahead of their own but, in a candid moment, tell you how unappreciated they feel� Procrastinate by submitting a job application late after hours of hard work, only to find the job filled� Make major decisions without considering the consequences� Automatically shun advice or a helping hand� Ignore a romantic partner's mistreatment, or stay in an unhealthy relationship even after deciding to leave� Overspend wildly, but get a steady stream of new credit card applications� Yearn to have children, but choose potential mates who clearly signal they aren't interested in being a parentEverybody Keeps SecretsSelf-sabotaging denial is universal even among the famous and powerful. Two presidents faced impeachment after sabotaging themselves. Richard Nixon tried to cover up Watergate. Bill Clinton tried to cover up the Monica Lewinsky affair. Despite each man's strengths and accomplishments, their presidencies descended into embarrassment not only because they tried to keep secrets from the public, but because they kept secrets from themselves.Nixon audiotaped the Oval Office, then proceeded to repeatedly break the law and incriminate himself with the tapes running. What was he thinking? In wanting a record for posterity, he tied his own noose. Call it denial, a tragic flaw, or karma, Nixon engineered his march to the brink of impeachment and subsequent resignation.Clinton had an affair, but steadfastly denied it to a grand jury, friends, and the public. Then he admitted it. How could a man so intelligent use such poor judgment in his personal behavior, lie about it, then fail to take into account the damage that would ensue when his lie was exposed?Both Nixon and Clinton were in denial. Despite the immense power and responsibility of the office, the men who have been president and the women and men who will be president are just like you and me. They mislead, distract, and undermine themselves.What drives this phenomenon that has brought down presidents, kings, and the rich and powerful? Self-defeating denial has the power to hurt you and those you love in ways large and small. Most of us put a premium on not hurting others. Yet we hurt ourselves with a vast array of self-defeating behaviors.One reason it can be difficult always to act in your best interests is that behavior occurs along a continuum of awareness. At one end, you have little or no awareness of your actions or their negative consequences until afterward. At the opposite end, you know full well that what you're doing isn't in your best interests, but you do it anyway. In between, your awareness may be diffuse, for example an inkling or vague concern. It may be fleeting--a mental warning that passes quickly. You may know what to do but can't summon the motivation to act. Or you have competing motivations and can't choose.The following table illustrates this continuum.No matter where you find yourself on the continuum of awareness, denial plays a role. When you have no clue that you're getting in your way, your denial is total. You have little chance of avoiding unnecessary losses and no choice about the outcome. At best, you get lucky. Yet even when it seems as though you see the complete picture, something may be overlooked. Denial clouds your ability to see what you are doing, why you're doing it, and the negative consequences. As with the moment of falling asleep, something goes unwitnessed. It may be something you're distracting yourself from, pretending about, or bringing selective inattention to. Perhaps you lack a full recognition of the risks. Perhaps you silently abandon your values.Counterproductive efforts to sidestep loss:1. Tend to be reactive rather than chosen2. Are more likely to arise when you don't see all your optionsThe remedy for both is greater self-awareness.Self-deception Takes Many FormsOur secrets can be difficult to spot because they take so many forms. One of the most subtle ways of undermining ourselves is what social scientists sometimes term "self-handicapping."<i>Steven, now a distinguished and able engineer, nearly failed his licensing exam. He initially answered the multiple-choice test on scrap paper rather than on the exam sheet. He finished with a half hour to spare and began reviewing his answers, after which he intended to transfer the answers to the official scanner-ready sheet. The next thing he knew, the exam proctor announced, "Time is up, pencils down." Steven stared in shock at his empty answer sheet alongside his answers on scrap paper.</i><i>A sympathetic proctor allowed him to fill in the answer sheet under the proctor's scrutiny, and an appeal to the licensing board eventually allowed his score, which was significantly higher than average, to count.</i>&nbsp;<br>During the test, Steven felt that he was acting with good intentions. He wanted to be as certain of his answers as possible and hand in a pristine answer sheet without erasures or smudges. Afterward, his near-miss shook him. "I still don't know what I was thinking. If I were going to be all psychological about it, I suspect that my trial-run answer sheet might have to do with being nervous about making a final commitment to each answer," Steven says.Why would Steven fear commitments? One possibility is that he feared the blow to his self-esteem that a failure would trigger. Another possibility is that self-handicapping like Steven's can be an indirect way of protesting against authority when we feel we cannot directly or openly say no. In addition, self-handicapping covertly carries the potential to turn daunting situations into no-lose enterprises. If you put obstacles in your way and still triumph, your victory is all that much greater. Should you fail, you have ready-made explanations to excuse or mitigate your loss.There's nothing sinister or premeditated in self-handicapping. It happens when you haven't yet brought sufficient awareness to recognize and understand your counterproductive patterns.<i>Judy, a smart and competent attorney, nearly missed her shot at law school because she forgot to accept an offer of admission by the deadline. She was in her senior year of college and routinely met deadlines for her term papers and tests. She even submitted her law school financial aid package paperwork on time.

Only after a breakneck trip to a large city post of fice 100 miles away was Judy able to get her acceptance form postmarked before midnight to secure her admission to law school.</i>&nbsp;<br>Sometimes self-handicapping like Judy's is an attempt to resolve the dissonance between promising circumstances and a poor self-image.Judy grew up doubting her worth and abilities.

He shows the eased training standards at Marine boot camp and quotes many enlistees who think the regimen is not nearly tough enough. Drill instructors, for example, may not use profanity at trainees, nor touch them; the process of converting trainees into Leathernecks involves much physical instruction, close-order drill, exercises in marksmanship and simulated combat. The aim is to instill a sense of self-respect and confidence and, more importantly, esprit de corps. There is a chapter on female Marines, whose attrition rate is exceedingly high. Da Cruz's argument that training has become "too easy" is off-putting, as is his glorification of the Marine as "a different breed."

This thesis, however, is beside the point, since the approach to training has changed over the years, as have personnel needs. Boot training is not designed to make a complete Marine; it merely provides the basis for further training in individual units. Public, and perhaps high school, libraries may want a copy for young men interested in joining the Marine Corps. Edward Gibson, Union Coll.

In a world still stuck in the East/West coast paradigm of the '90s, Southern hip hop has dominated the genre-and defined the culture-for years. And the South's leading lights, most notably OutKast, Timbaland, and more recently, crunk superstars like the Ying Yang Twins and Lil Jon, have expanded the parameters of hip hop. <i>Third Coast</i> is the first book to deal with Southern hip hop as a matter of cultural history, and the first to explain the character and significance of down South rapping to fans as well as outsiders. It tells the story of recent hip hop, marking how far the music has come sonically and culturally since its well-documented New York-centered early years.</p><p><b>Roni Sarig</b> is the author of three books, including <i>The Secret History of Rock: The Most Influential Bands You've Never Heard</i>. His work has appeared in <i>Vibe</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and <i>Spin</i>.Though most casual fans know the story of hip-hop's birth in the ashes of the South Bronx, the story of the South's entry into the modern rap scene remains relatively unknown. Here, author and music writer Sarig (The Secret History of Rock) provides the "Dirty South" its first complete history, an ambitious tale featuring Southern industry luminaries like Pharrell Williams and Jermaine Dupri, as well as the acts mentioned in the subtitle. Sarig's chronicle boasts remarkable depth and breadth, covering every aspect of Southern hip-hop, including dozens-if not hundreds-of acts. Moving away from historical documentation to analysis can lead Sarig to make some questionable generalizations ("it's easy to observe that, today, the blues is almost entirely the province of middle-aged white people"), but his attention to the music itself reaches some dizzying pinnacles-as in deconstructing crunk lyrics to reveal connections to 11th century working-class Saxons. Throughout, Sarig is informative and entertaining, keeping an eye on the big picture while managing this huge swath of uncollected music history; though the necessary surfeit of details may wear out casual readers, Sarig ably connects the stories of record shops, roller discos and street corners from Houston to Miami to Virginia Beach. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was an era when floating art deco palaces like the Normandie and the Queen Mary, and elegant, speedy trains like Henry Dreyfuss' redesigned Twentieth Century Limited transformed the way people perceived travel. There are dazzling photographs-many never before published-of such art deco icons as Schultze and Weaver's soaring Waldorf Astoria, Jospeh Urban's Zeigfeld Theater and Central Park Casino, and the sky-piercing spire of William Van Alen's Chrysler Building.

After abandoning his youthful conversion to Catholicism, he rediscovers his Jewish roots as a teenager and builds a new life in Israeli politics.<br> &nbsp;<br> Friedl�nder's initial loyalty to Israel turns into a lifelong fascination with Jewish life and history. He struggles to process the ubiquitous effects of European anti-Semitism while searching for a more measured approach to the Zionism that surrounds him. Friedl�nder goes on to spend his adulthood shuttling between Israel, Europe, and the United States, armed with his talent for language and an expansive intellect. His prestige inevitably throws him up against other intellectual heavyweights. In his early years in Israel, he rubs shoulders with the architects of the fledgling state and brilliant minds such as Gershom Scholem and Carlo Ginzburg, among others.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most importantly, this memoir led Friedl�nder to reflect on the wrenching events that induced him to devote sixteen years of his life to writing his Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece, <i>The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945</i>.</p><p><b>Saul Friedl�nder</b> is an award-winning Israeli historian and currently a professor of history at UCLA. He was born in Prague to a family of German-speaking Jews, grew up in France, and experienced the German Occupation of 1940-1944. His historical works have garnered much praise and recognition, including the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction for his book <i>The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945</i>.&#x201c;When Memory Comes retains the very texture of recollection in a literary style characterized by tact and elegance...[the book] is faithful to the workings of memory: It doesn&#x2019;t arrive all at once; it reappears, often without warning, to interrupt the present with the aroma, and the pain, of the past... Where Memory Leads describes in more prosaic, chronological form the itinerary of a historian whose life work has been to piece together an account of massive, state-sponsored crimes while making a place for the voices of those mercilessly persecuted...When Memory Comes was written in the key of memory, a register replete with sensation and emotion but that can offer no lessons. Where Memory Leads is written in the key of history, a register that moves from meaning to message. Here, the author is crystal clear. &#x2018;The only lesson one could draw from the Shoah was precisely the imperative: stand against injustice.&#x2019; Obligation fulfilled.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>&#x2014; Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;[<i>When Memory Comes]</i> is a small classic of Holocaust literature. With a light brush, bringing events in and out of focus, the author depicts his early years in Prague, where he was born in 1932 to Jewish parents who considered themselves culturally German; the family&#x2019;s move to Paris and flight to Vichy; his seclusion and conversion in a Catholic seminary; his parents&#x2019; attempted escape to Switzerland and their disappearance, ultimately to die in Auschwitz. It is a shattering story, written in 1977 in Israel, where Friedl�nder went first to fight and later to teach, salted with observations on the Jewish state and relations with the Palestinians, a never-ending debate in which he participates forcefully from the left. <i>Where Memory Leads</i> follows suit, telling a painful post-war story both personal and national, woven into discussions of teaching posts outside Israel, in Geneva and Los Angeles, where he is emeritus professor of history at UCLA.&#x201d;<b><i> <br></i></b>&#x2013;<i>&nbsp;Guardian (US)&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;Friedlander, who lost his parents in the Holocaust and survived as a child hidden in a catholic seminary in central France, went on to become an accomplished polyglot, at home in Israel, Europe and the United States. Friedlander's childhood...was the subject of a first, more typical "survivor" memoir, titled "When Memory Comes."...the book is a fractured and evocative account of Friedlander's early years and separation from his parents, written in Israel in the heavy aftermath of the Yom Kippur War. &#x201d;Where Memory Leads&#x201d; is a more literal project...More than anything else &#x201c;Where Memory Leads&#x201d; chronicles Friedlander&#x2019;s professional success, in particular his most significant achievement: a two-volume history of the Nazis and the Jews from 1933 to 1945, a period he divides into &#x201c;the years of persecution&#x201d; and &#x201c;the years of extermination.&#x201d;... In it, Friedlander deftly wove an account of Nazi policies with records of the daily life of Germans and testimony from victims...Friedlander, more than most, has made lasting contributions to scholarship &#x2013; in his writing on the Nazi era, but also in his role investigating the relationships between the Nazis and powerful institutions, corporations and nations. With a cleareyed moral imperative, he opposes the Palestinian occupation, repeatedly demands accountability from Israeli leaders for their support of West Bank settlements and rails against use of the Shoah as a pretext for mistreatment of Palestinians.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014; <i>The New York Times Book Review&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;Friedl�nder (history, Univ. of California, Los Angeles; The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939&#x2013;1945), a leading Holocaust scholar, has given us a follow-up of sorts to his 1977 memoir, When Memory Comes. While that title focused on his childhood and the tragic separation from his parents (who were killed during the Holocaust), this one ranges across his life. The primary focus is on his intellectual and political development and ambivalent relationship, both politically and as a citizen, with Israel. A charming aspect of the book is the author&#x2019;s frequent and ironic acknowledgement that memory doesn&#x2019;t always work the way we want it to...Friedl�nder is an engaging writer and personality. This is an important book for readers interested in intellectual history and the history of Israel.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;Ultimately, Friedl�nder would become both an apologist for Israeli policies and a critic of its racism toward the Palestinians. However, he embarked on graduate work in international studies in Geneva in 1961, pursuing his studies in his "monomaniacal way," supporting a family yet suffering from debilitating anxiety that required intensive drugs as well as psychoanalysis. His initial book exposing the complicity between Pius XII and the Nazi regime led him to devote his subsequent work to European fascism, modern anti-Semitism, and the Holocaust. A "difficult stay in Berlin in the mid-eighties," when he was confronted by a new wave of "apologetic" scholarship about Nazi Germany, reinforced his decision about his work... the book is haunting in scope and depth.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Kirkus Reviews&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;Written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning Holocaust historian who came to call him�self Saul Friedlander, When Memory Comes was published in 1978; translated from the French by Helen Lane, the book was recog�nized as a lapidary masterpiece, evoking the author's traumatic childhood, his conver�sion to Catholicism, and his gradual redis�covery of his Jewish roots in adolescence with the lightest of touches. . . For those who missed out on the book when it origi�nally appeared, it has now been reissued, with an elegant introduction by Claire Messud, in tandem with a new memoir, Where Memory Leads, which picks up threads of the earlier narrative. . .Where Memory Leads is an intellectual as well as personal meditation, and among the many pleasures of reading itis the lucid and insightful analysis it provides of the Israeli occupation, its sources in Israeli myths of the Sabra and of national memory,&nbsp;and &#x2018;the danger of a moral degradation that the occupation could foster within Israeli soci�ety.&#x2019; . . .&nbsp;This is a book about growing up in the shadow of a dark history�...Friedlander's memoir, in its rigorous attention to the major and minor devastations that his life has wrought, will set you thinking about your own responses to the collective damage of history. And yet, for all the gravity of his reflections, Friedlander is never self-important, nor does his prose swell.&nbsp;Indeed, it's a tribute to his consuming honesty and taste for understatement that the reader comes away with a sense of the com�plexity and hesitancy&nbsp;that marks a life that, in other hands, might have been presented as one long triumphal march.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>&#x2014; BookForum&nbsp;<br></i><br>&#x201c;When Memory Comes is a small masterpiece in the literature of the Holocaust. Its new sequel, Where Memory Leads, is a more conventional kind of memoir because it deals with a more normal, adult life, but it displays the same probing intelligence at work. ... Taken together, these books form a primary document of modern Jewish history&#x2014;a contribution to the study of the past that uses the tools not of the historian, but of the autobiographer. A scholar attempts to ascertain details and facts, and synthesize them into a complete narrative. A memoirist, however, knows that what matters most about the past, the way it felt, is always elusive, partial, reconstructed rather than recollected.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;</i> <i>Tablet Magazine&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;When Memory Comes is a quiet and deeply affecting masterpiece. Spare in its language, it charts the same melancholy terrain as W, or the Memory of Childhood, the 1975 novel by the French experimental writer Georges Perec, which also told the wartime tale of a child&#x2019;s separation from his parents. But where Perec interwove autobiography with imagination, shifting between his own life and the dystopian fiction of an island country called &#x201c;W,&#x201d; Friedl�nder obeyed the historian&#x2019;s code, sticking resolutely to the realm of fact. He nonetheless played with temporality: As if prolonged attention would be too much to bear, every few pages he snatched the reader back from the past to the present, from the Europe of the 1940s to his own current life in 1970s Israel. Four decades later, Friedl�nder has now published a companion piece. Where Memory Leads is a very different sort of book, more conventional in structure&#x2014;�it unfolds chronologically&#x2014;�and more prosaic in its themes. When Memory Comes has a truly Proustian ambition: to save from oblivion the moments from childhood that might otherwise have been lost. Though its memory remains charged with longing, Friedl�nder later tries to capture the happy experience, only to realize that the original taste can never be wholly recovered ... [it is] an absorbing tale of personal and professional transformation.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>&nbsp;The Nation&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;This autobiography records both the public and the private sides of Friedlander&#x2019;s life story.

It describes his family life and the way he has adjusted to the different places in which he has lived, as well.&nbsp;His grandchildren will learn much from this account.

Both are wonderful accounts of a man who went from Holocaust survivor to important roles in the Israeli government to a far more critical approach to his adopted country later in life as he became more widely known as the most prominent Israeli historian on the Holocaust.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;&nbsp;World Literature Today&nbsp;<br><br></i>&#x201c;Saul Friedlander&#x2019;s memoir is a remarkable inquiry into the truths of a paradoxical identity.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;&nbsp;Times Literary Supplement&nbsp;<br><br></i>&#x201c;Saddled with this memory and this knowledge, perhaps one can no longer live spontaneously, without thought, "in a total movement,, An adult life, after this sort of childhood, would tend to lead to deep self�examination and a constant dissatisfaction - in other words, the life of the modern � secularized Jew.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;&nbsp;The Jewish Herald-Voice&nbsp;<br><br></i>&#x201c;More than the memoirs of a Holocaust survivor and scholar, Friedl�nder&#x2019;s two volumes of memoirs are about identity: the loss of identity, the confusion of identity, the difficulty in reclaiming one. His casual manner of storytelling is engaging, and there&#x2019;s no way to be bothered about his uncertainty over whether an event occurred in January or February of a given month, since it adds to a certain verbal aspect to the writing. They are the work of man seeking not only his past and his identity, but also trying to get as close to the truth as is possible, and there can be no higher praise than this.&#x201d;<i> <i>&#x2014;&nbsp;</i>Jewish Current Magazine<br></i><br>"Taken together, <i>When Memory Comes&nbsp;</i>and <i>Where Memory Leads </i>form a powerful<br> testament to the Holocaust&#x2019;s reality and its legacy, one that is at once scholarly and profoundly personal.They also offer a thought-provoking study of the psychological impact of trauma; the ways in which we&nbsp;alternately hide and seek the truth, and the incremental and often painful path to acceptance, and perhaps&nbsp;even peace."&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;&nbsp;The Common&nbsp;</i><br><br>"This is a very moving memoir about the&nbsp;personal and psychological toll of the Holocaust."&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;&nbsp;New York Post&nbsp;<br><br></i>&#x201c;<i>When Memory Comes</i> has just been republished together with Friedlander&#x2019;s new, and far longer, memoir, <i>Where Memory Leads</i>, which picks up where the earlier volume left off. His new memoir is similarly concerned with the dynamics and problems of retrieval. But, then, there is memory&#x2014;and there is memory. The profound and traumatic issues, the unique and highly personalized stakes of memory that lie at the heart of the first volume, give way to the irritating, quotidian issues of memory that afflict all of us at a certain stage in our lives. The painful grandeur, the tragic tale of an innocent child swept into a cataclysmic event, the other-worldly quality of the first volume has been replaced by an ageing man&#x2019;s quite normal struggle simply to remember names and words.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014; Jewish Review of Books&nbsp;<br></i><br>&#x201c;<i>Where Memory Leads: My Life</i> is an incredibly sad and moving book.

In the second part, Neusner spells out theological reasons underlying the &#34;myth&#34; of a Judeo-Christian tradition. He calls for an understanding of religions as systems so that each party can describe fully, honestly, and accurately the religion it proposes to bring into dialogue with the other. Only when both parties grasp what is meant in context can dialogue actually occur. Throughout this absorbing book, Professor Neusner summons readers to make an effort to treat as legitimate and authentic religions other than their own, and to value a religion&#39;s account of itself. Then genuine dialogue may be possible, and such dialogue is essential for world peace.

Nunn&#x2019;s literary reputation has been built over the course of five novels that create stories of suspense in the myriad subcultures of California, including the surfing world, the Mojave Desert, the Mexico borderlands, and the exurban zones of drug use and nasty violence. His writing is formal yet lush, and often laced with a chilling black humor. <i>Newsweek</i> said Nunn&#x2019;s <i>The Dogs of Winter</i> is &#x201c;the greatest novel ever written about surfing,&#x201d; while <i>The Washington Post</i> called him the &#x201c;principal heir to the tradition of Raymond Chandler and Nathanael West.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nunn&#x2019;s new novel is a dark book involving psychiatric mystery, sexual obsession, fractured identities, and terrifyingly realistic violence&#x2014;a tale told amid the back streets of California&#x2019;s Bay Area, far from the cleansing breezes of the ocean. This is a landscape where nameless persons lose their identities and find new ones after days of sex in a motel room, where homeless war veterans create neo-hippie encampments&#x2014;this is California noir, this is Kem Nunn country. It&#x2019;s not pretty, it&#x2019;s not sweet, but it is disturbing and unforgettable.<br> <br>The antihero of this book, Dr. Eldon Chance, a neuropsychiatrist, is a man primed for spectacular ruin.

Jaclyn appears to be suffering from a dissociative identity disorder. In time, Chance will fall into bed with her&#x2014;or is it with her alter ego, the voracious and volatile Jackie Black? The not-so-good doctor, despite his professional training, isn&#x2019;t quite sure&#x2014;and thereby hangs his fascination with her. But when you get Jaclyn, you get her husband, Raymond, a formidable and dangerous adversary.<br> <br>Meanwhile, Chance also meets a young man named D, a self-styled, streetwise philosopher skilled in the art of the blade. It is around this trio of unique and dangerous individuals that longguarded secrets begin to unravel, obsessions grow, and the doctor&#x2019;s carefully arranged life comes to the brink of implosion.<br> <br>Amid San Francisco&#x2019;s fluid, ever-shifting fog, in the cool, gray city of love, Dr. Chance will at last be forced to live up to his name. <i>Chance</i> is a twisted, harrowing, and impossible-to-put-down head trip through the fun house of fate, mesmerizing until the very last page.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, February 2014:</strong> Eldon Chance is a neuropsychiatrist in crisis.

At the start of this smart, twisty, and addictive book, Dr. Chance&#x2019;s life--&#x201c;the life he&#x2019;d so carefully arranged for himself&#x201d;--is falling apart. His costly divorce forces him to sell his antique furniture, a decision that introduces him to the remarkable character named Big D, a hulking, unhinged, tattooed, self-proclaimed Iraq war vet turned furniture restorer who becomes buttoned-up Chance&#x2019;s unlikely friend, mentor, and potential savior. Something of an amateur philosopher (as well as a self-taught Samurai), Big D is drawn to people&#x2019;s frozen lake obsessions--the things they want so bad they&#x2019;re willing to walk to the center of a frozen lake, &#x201c;where the ice is thinnest.&#x201d; Chance&#x2019;s frozen-lake desire is one of his patients, the mysterious and dangerously manipulative Jaclyn Blackstone--or, more accurately, her sexier alter-ego, Jackie Black. In his reckless pursuit of Jaclyn/Jackie, Chance confronts her corrupt and abusive husband, an Oakland homicide detective, Romanian thugs, and his own secret past. --<em>Neal Thompson</em><br>Kem Nunn is a third-generation Californian whose previous novels include&nbsp;<i>The Dogs of Winter</i>,&nbsp;<i>Pomona Queen</i>,&nbsp;<i>Unassigned Territory</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Tapping the Source</i>, which was made in to&nbsp;the film <i>Point Break</i>.&nbsp;<i>Tijuana Straits&nbsp;</i>won the Los Angeles Times Book Award.

It was here that he wrote <i>The Reluctant Dragon</i>, which was first published in <i>Dream Days</i> in 1898, ten years before the publication of his most famous work, <i>The Wind in the Willows.</i><br><br>Ernest Howard Shepard (December 10, 1879 &#x2013; March 24, 1976) was an English artist and book illustrator. He was known especially for his human-like animals in illustrations for <i>The Wind in the Willows </i>by Kenneth Grahame and <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i> by A. A. Milne.<br><br>Leonard S. Marcus is the children's book industry's most respected historian and critic. His many books include<i> Margaret Wise Brown: Awakened by the Moon</i> and <i>Dear Genius: The Letters of Ursula Nordstrom.</i> He is a frequent contributor to the <i>New York Times Book Review, Washington Post Book World, Parenting</i> magazine, the <i>Horn Book,</i> and <i>Publishers Weekly.</i></p><h2>America&#39;s Real War</h2><p>There is a tug of war going on for the future of America. At one end of the rope are those who think America is a secular nation; at the other end are those who believe religion is at the root of our country&#39;s foundation. In this paperback release of the thought-provoking America&#39;s Real War, renowned leader and speaker Rabbi Daniel Lapin encourages America to re-embrace the Judeo-Christian values on which our nation was founded, and logically demonstrates why those values are crucial to America&#39;s strength in the new millennium.</p><p>Rabbi Daniel Lapin is a businessman, author, syndicated talk radio host, and speaker. He is the president of Toward Tradition, a nonprofit educational organization, and the founder of Cascadia Business Institute. His articles have appeared in such publications as the Wall Street Journal, National Review, The American Enterprise, the Washington Times, and others. He and his wife, Susan, are enthusiastic sailors and live on Mercer Island, Washington, where they homeschool their seven children.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br>WHY WOULD A RABBI ALLY WITH RELIGIOUS CHRISTIANS?<br><i>America Is Indeed Imperiled. We Just Disagree with One Another About<br>What the Source of the Danger Is.</i><br><br>Acaptured prisoner of war is required to declare only his name, rank, service<br>number, and date of birth. This is because all the truly profound<br>information about him is already revealed by his uniform. That distinctive<br>garment eloquently proclaims the side for which the warrior is fighting.<br>It equally effectively reveals those values for which the soldier is willing to risk his<br>life.<br><br>Although not a prisoner of war, I am among those engaged in a fierce American conflict. It may be the fiercest internal conflict in American history since the Abolitionist<br>movement in the 1800s. It is certainly deeply consequential. And I am in the heart of it. This book is my uniform.<br><br>In addition to the information contained in my uniform, the U.S. Military Code of<br>Conduct grants you the right to the equivalent of my name, rank, service number, and<br>date of birth. Here is the vital data: I am an Orthodox rabbi. I am the son of a famous<br>Orthodox rabbi and the brother of two more. My teachers were the great scholars who<br>headed the Gateshead Talmudic Academy in England, some of whom were uncles and<br>cousins. I became a disciple of my great-uncle, the revered Rabbi Eliyahu (Elijah) Lopian (the original family name) during my many years of study at the theological academy (or yeshiva) of Kfar Hassidim in Israel. Although I often fall short, I do my best to live my life and raise my children according to the laws of the five books of Moses, our holy Torah, and the customs of Moses and of Israel.<br><br>Because it is so unusual these days for a rabbi to say nice things about Christians, I<br>consider it necessary to explain that I am not now, nor have I ever been, a Christian. I<br>profess no special expertise of the books known as the New Testament. Being infatuated with Judaism and the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, I dedicate my study time to expanding my familiarity with Jewish theology. In the midst of a lifelong love affair with the searing truth of the Torah, I reject any notion of theological compatibility between Judaism and Christianity; I do not believe a Jew can also be a Christian without betraying his Judaism. One faith, Judaism, has produced the longest-lasting, continuous culture in the history of the world, while the other, Christianity, has been responsible, among other things, for the founding of America, the greatest civilization the world has ever known, and for making America great. This book will describe how a weakened Christianity in America threatens all Americans, including Jews.<br><br>WHY I FIGHT THIS BATTLE<br>My defense of a religion other than my own has earned me considerable hostility from<br>many Americans. This book will also describe why so many secularized Americans and<br>so many Jews wrongly fear Christianity in America today.<br><br>Why have I willingly volunteered to fight this battle? Why have I subjected my wife<br>and children, as well as my friends, to all the disruptions, difficulties&#x2014;and yes, dangers&#x2014;of this struggle? I find myself driven to defend American Christian conservatives for three compelling reasons.<br><br>The first is because I desperately want my children, and one day (God willing) my<br>grandchildren and their descendants, to have the option of living peacefully and productively<br>in the United States of America. I am certain this depends upon America<br>regaining its Christian-oriented moral compass.<br><br>The second reason is that I am appalled by the great injustice being perpetrated by<br>those Jewish organizations that engage in anti-Christian bigotry. Although many of them were founded explicitly to fight bigotry, and for many years did just that, today the shrill rhetoric and hate-filled propaganda found in their direct mail is discriminatory and divisive. The very same Jewish organizations would be the loudest protesters were anything even remotely similar being said by non-Jews about Jews. Justice demands that a member of the group doing the defaming also does the defending. God&#x2019;s blueprint clearly included the emergence of Christianity. After all, Christianity has brought monotheism to more people than any other force during the past two millennia. American Jews in particular, owe a debt of gratitude to Christians for the safe haven America has been since its founding.<br><br>Third, I wish to counter the chilul Hashem, the desecration of God&#x2019;s name, that is<br>caused when His words are misrepresented. Organizations and individuals, many of<br>whom claim to speak in the name of Judaism, are inflicting enormous harm on America<br>by promoting policies that traditional Judaism finds abhorrent. I want to help both<br>Jewish and non-Jewish Americans differentiate between Jewish positions and positions<br>held by some Jews who are more devoted to secularism than Judaism.<br><br>In defending Christianity in America, I am not suggesting that Jews ought to<br>embrace the Christian faith. I believe that all Jews should actively embrace traditional<br>Judaism; I have spent many years of my life helping to bring that about. But I am suggesting, at the very least, that Jews should stop speaking and acting as if Christian<br>America is their enemy. I feel that all Americans who love freedom, whether or not they<br>are religious, should be reassured, not frightened, by the reawakening of earnest<br>Christianity throughout the land. I shall try to establish that Jews as well as other minorities have the most to fear from a post-Christian America.<br><br>A NATION IN CRISIS<br>I believe America is in decline&#x2014;not compared to five or ten years ago, but when compared to the years following World War II up until the early sixties. Most Americans who can remember back thirty-five years or so sense that life has become more squalid, expensive, and dangerous. Some attribute this to inadequate government attention to social problems, while others lay the blame on a more fundamental spiritual malaise. One thing is clear however: fewer and fewer Americans remain unaware of, or indifferent to America&#x2019;s decline. Whether it is in the hollow expressions on the faces of some youngsters, the vulgarity of entertainment, or the many other little signs that all is not well in America, most of us are at least concerned about the future.<br><br>There is a tug-of-war going on for the future of our country. Some are enthusiastic<br>pullers for one or the other side. Many other Americans remain uncommitted to the<br>entire agenda of either side but feel the need to make their voices heard one way or the other.<br><br>What do the two ends of the rope represent? I believe the basic question is whether<br>America is a secular or a religious nation. The very question sizzles with tension. Almost everybody has an opinion on this one. Furthermore, it is becoming less of an opinion and more of a deeply held fundamental worldview. Whichever view people hold, they do so with utter conviction.<br><br>One end of the rope is anchored by those who ask, &#x201c;How can any intelligent, rational<br>person late in the twentieth century view America as a religious nation?&#x201d; Some put it<br>this way, &#x201c;Do you really want to live in a theocracy? Look at Iran.&#x201d; To people on this end of the rope, Judeo-Christian tradition represents primitive tribalism and intolerance, the most damning indictment of our age.<br><br>The folks on this end of the rope are joined by many citizens who used to occupy<br>the undecided middle ground. While lacking a doctrinal embrace of secularism, these<br>Americans have come to feel that religious America poses the real threat to our continuity, so they instinctively migrate to the end of the rope opposite from religious conservatives. Although not committed to every nuance of secularism, they consider it the lesser of two evils and lend their not inconsiderable weight to the left of the rope.<br><br>Across the field on the other end, are those Americans who feel increasingly alienated<br>by this &#x201c;enlightened&#x201d; perspective which denies the importance of America&#x2019;s history<br>and culture. These religious conservatives are joined by many other Americans who,<br>while admittedly unenthusiastic about religion, are even less enthusiastic about the<br>changes that secular liberalism has brought about in their towns and communities.<br><br>In the pages following, I will argue that America is a religious nation and the corresponding interpretation of our history and culture is the correct one. But I shall go much further than that. America is not just religious but is rooted in one particular religious tradition. As an Orthodox rabbi, I will make a compelling case for America as a Christian nation and the need for our nation to be based on Judeo-Christian ethics in order to survive. Despite the fact that Judaism and Christianity have totally differing theologies, there is still one Judeo-Christian ethic. Which is to say that how people order their lives and societies; how they organize their families and behave toward one another turns out to be more similar than different. The origins, legal system, ethos and moral sense of America are entirely Judeo-Christian.<br><br>A Jew and a Christian at one end of the rope have more in common with one another<br>in terms of vision for this country than each may have with his coreligionists at the other end. This is because the tug-of-war is not about theological or philosophical differences but about real life disagreements about things like taxes, crime, welfare, and family life. No matter the philosophy of belief that brings us to our view of how things ought to be, we tend to agree with others holding the same view regardless of the belief that brought them to that view.<br><br>But this begs another question asked by well-intentioned but worried Americans.<br>Many of those pulling for the secular side of the tug-of-war may concede that there is at least some truth to the Judeo-Christian religious foundation of America. At the same time they argue that nowadays a new secular public policy posture has become necessary because of America&#x2019;s increasing diversity. Otherwise, they argue, America will become intolerant of its minorities who may not share in our founding ethic. The question for those who take this position is not, &#x201c;Is America a Christian nation?&#x201d; but &#x201c;Should America be a Christian nation?&#x201d; As a non-Christian myself, I still insist the answer must be yes. I shall try to demonstrate that the choice is between a benign Christian culture and a sinister secular one.<br><br>I feel that although they may seem unrelated, almost every social pathology and<br>nearly every sign of civic disarray can be traced to one thing: the extirpation of religion<br>from American public life during the past three and a half decades. Very little tells us as much about a culture than how it views the transcendent questions of life. A culture&#x2019;s<br>prospects for success and durability are best revealed by examining what it considers the purpose of life, what is death, how sex should be treated, and similar questions that most of us answer in one of only two ways. Either we consult the traditions of our faith, or, rejecting faith, we seek emotionally satisfying answers. Sometimes we later buttress the answers we have already chosen.<br><br>WHAT WILL LIFE BE LIKE FOR OUR CHILDREN?<br>One of the great gifts of serious religion is the idea of hierarchy. Some things are better than others and some things are more evil than others. It is a greater good to bestow charity on a poor man by offering him a net along with instructions for its use rather than to fling him a fish. Attacking a passerby in order to steal her purse is a greater evil than smoking a cigarette. We must renew our confidence in making moral judgments. We have to be able to identify the direction in which trends are moving. If there is moral movement in each generation, we need to know the direction and the velocity of the movement. This helps us understand what tomorrow might look like, and it helps us decide whether we welcome that particular vision of tomorrow for our children. If our culture is changing rapidly, as I think it may be doing, and if we are changing by becoming coarser and more subject to the tireless ministrations of a government determined to become ever more involved in every corner of citizens&#x2019; lives, then I experience great concern. It means that we are further under water than we were last generation. And if nothing is going to change that course, what will life be like for our children?<br><br>This great American civilization, perhaps the greatest the world has ever known, is<br>not facing imminent extinction. However, life deteriorates significantly long before the<br>very end. And it usually deteriorates fastest for those most dependent on society&#x2019;s civilizing institutions. Those not big and fearsome enough to defend themselves suffer more than others when city streets and parks become menacing. Those not wealthy enough to afford private schools for their children suffer most when public education fails. Those who live from paycheck to paycheck are most vulnerable to creeping and constant tax increases. Those trying to raise children who will honor their parents and their parents&#x2019; values are most hampered by antifamily legislation and antifamily entertainment. Those trying to build new business enterprises find themselves crippled by confiscatory taxation and crippling regulation.<br><br>Are you Jewish, Christian, or neither? Are you indifferent to religion, fervently for, or<br>ardently opposed to faith? It matters little. As long as you devoutly wish for America to<br>remain a beacon of hope and freedom in this troubled world, I appeal to you. Ideas do<br>have consequences and big ideas have big consequences. If there exists an idea bigger than God, I do not know what it might be. What Americans feel about God probably has greater impact on our national future than what we think about almost anything else. Or to put it another way, what we really think about God deep down within our hearts is likely to influence what we think about almost everything else.<br><br>I intend to show you how changing attitudes about God have almost entirely<br>reshaped America during the past three or four decades. Furthermore, I want to show<br>how virtually every one of us has been a participant, sometimes unwittingly, in allowing<br>these changes to take place. Some of us have actively helped to bring these changes about in the belief that we have been improving society. Others have been swept along by the loud enthusiasms of the changers and our passive acceptance of each small step has allowed these big changes to envelop our lives.<br><br>I intend this book as a guide to what we have done, to what we have allowed to take<br>place, and to where it all might lead. Those readers who applaud the changes will smile<br>knowingly as I identify the milestones on our road downhill. Those who tremble at what<br>we have come to accept as normal will see my words as a road map for retracing our steps and regaining the right path to continue the great story that is American history.<br><br>America is indeed imperiled. We all know that. We just disagree with one another<br>about what the source of the danger is. Some think religious fervor threatens while others feel that secularism is the danger.</p><h2>The End of the World</h2><p>Accounts of the apocalyptic endings of previous civilizations, cultures, and peoples--from the sack of Rome to Auschwitz--form an inquiry into disaster, atrocity, and resilience</p><p></p><h2>Standard Catalog of World Paper Money, Specialized Issues, Volume One (STANDARD CATALOG OF WORLD PAPER MONEY VOL 1: SPECIALIZED ISSUES)</h2><p>The demand for collectible world paper money continues to grow, and the ninth edition of this definitive resource for specialized paper notes is completely updated and expanded to reflect the most current values and new varieties.

Laure Beausejour has been taken from her destitute family and raised in an infamous orphanage to be trained as a lace maker. Striking and willful, she dreams of becoming a seamstress and catching the eye of a nobleman. But after complaining about her living conditions, she is sent to Canada as a <em>fille du roi</em>, expected to marry a French farmer there.

I Think My Dad is an Alcoholic, Mt. I'm Getting Divorced and Mt. The Doctor Says It's Cancer-and assure readers that they can surmount all hills if they just get help and get moving. They "don't have all the answers," and the answers they do offer are familiar ones: embrace hope, love, strength, tenderness, faith and joy, and eschew regret, denial and fear. The book's main virtue is not its message, but the unstinting positive reinforcement it offers to those stuck in the doldrums. The authors commiserate with their own experiences of dysfunction, including broken families, alcoholism, a suicide attempt, and depression, and congratulate readers for having already scaled the formidable summits of surviving birth and achieving literacy. And while they acknowledge that climbing life's mountains is hard, they insist there is still ample opportunity for raffish joie de vivre, to "be amazed, be humble, be goofy, be alive" with "some zing, some zip, some zeal." By turns jaunty, cajoling and sentimental, the book's tone, intermittently megaphoned in all-caps aphorisms ("ONLY LOVE CAN BREAK YOUR HEART") can at times seem as cloying and insubstantial as a pop ballad. Still, readers in a shallow funk may find its lyrical platitudes and warm reassurances that "YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB" to be an encouraging tonic. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>David Beckham: My Side - The Autobiography</h2><p>With endless newspaper column inches devoted to one of the most talked about men in the world, it seems that we know everything there is to know about David Beckham. Or do we? This is Beckham&#39;s life story in his own words. The book deals with his complex relationship with United boss Alex Ferguson and looks at how he handles the pressure of playing alongside some of the most volatile footballers of his generation, from the likes of Cantona, Schmeichel and Keane. It tells the England story, from being vilified by the nation before returning as the prodigal son and almost single-handedly guiding his country as captain to the 2002 World Cup Finals. From Beckham himself, we gain an insight into the family man behind the famous footballer, the international model and fashion leader. He describes how he first met and then married ex-Spice girl Victoria Adams and the upbringing of their two children Brooklyn and Romeo. He goes on to discuss how his family&#39;s every step is monitored by a posse of newshounds and paparazzi. He also tells of the influence of his parents, growing up as a shy youngster in the family home and how their subsequent split affected him. The book was written with the assistance of Tom Watt.</p><p>David Beckham was born in Leytonstone, East London in May 1975. At the age of 11 he came first in the Bobby Charlton Soccer Schools competition ahead of 5,000 other boys. He signed for Manchester United in 1989 and made his debut three years later, aged 17. He has since gone on to play more than fifty times for England, including captaining his country in the 2002 World Cup Finals.&#39;The confrontations between Beckham and Ferguson have the acid marks of authenticity&#39; Mail on Sunday&#39;Skilfully written&#39; Evening Standard&#39;Utterly fascinating&#39; Heat magazine&#39;A sensational story&#39; The Sun&#39;This book sings&#39; Daily Telegraph</p><h2>Only As the Day Is Long: New and Selected Poems</h2><p><p><strong>A collection of new and selected works from a prize-winning poet known to bear compassionate and ruthless witness to the quotidian.</strong></p><p><em>Only as the Day Is Long</em> represents a brilliant, daring body of work from one of our boldest contemporary poets, known to bear compassionate and ruthless witness to the quotidian.

These cultures shared the tradition of building mounds, probably relating to burial ceremonies.

Or bound in chains and stuck in a dark little hole where she couldn&#x2019;t drive sane men crazy, Kell Krieger thought with a grin as he kept a careful distance between himself and Emily&#x2019;s Trailblazer as they traversed Atlanta&#x2019;s increasingly heavy traffic flow.Were it the Middle Ages, he would have rescued her from a dark hole or the stake, outfitted her in leather, given her a sword and followed her into battle. Because sure as hell, any man who saw her coming at him would have been struck dumb long enough for a strong warrior to lop his head from his shoulders.But it wasn&#x2019;t the Middle Ages, and Atlanta&#x2019;s traffic wasn&#x2019;t really a war zone, it just resembled one sometimes. Like now, just before rush hour, when those fighting to escape the maddening traffic jams were driving like kamikaze students with no fear of death.Emily certainly had no fear. But then again, he couldn&#x2019;t remember a time when she had known fear. Even when she should have, the time she was bound and shoved into a dirty shack on the Fuentes compound and glared at her captors with hatred.What she had on the freeway was experience. Someone had taught her aggressive driving techniques that would have done a SEAL proud. Hell, she had lost the tail he was certain she hadn&#x2019;t known she had, miles back.Research. He was betting she had taken some kind of lessons on the pretext of research for the books that were never published and stories that were still only half finished.And he had to grin at the thought of that. She was driving her father crazy with the so-called research, and over the years she had given Kell no end of amusement as he listened to the senator rant and rave about her exploits on the rare occasions Kell had managed to meet with him over the years.But now, the danger she was in had him and the senator sweating, especially after her kidnapping by Fuentes nearly two years ago.She wasn&#x2019;t safe. And the way she wrapped her bodyguards around her slender fingers, they would be of no help to her when Fuentes decided to take her again, as the information suggested he would. She wasn&#x2019;t safe, but she thought she could protect herself. She was just smart enough to be dangerous to herself, and too gentle to ever be a danger to the evil stalking her.They thought she was safe. God help him, he had believed Fuentes would adhere to the rules of the game and leave her be after her rescue from the first kidnapping. And perhaps he would have, if the spy codenamed Mr. White hadn&#x2019;t grown increasingly worried about her father&#x2019;s efforts to track him down.Now, here was Emily, fighting to find a life despite her father&#x2019;s overprotection and the shadow of danger. For seven years she had lived with one bodyguard after another, had endured her father&#x2019;s overprotective love, and had tried to balance her needs against his fears.From the look of things, she had grown tired of the battle, though.Today, she wore the disguise she had been using for the past week before heading from her condo on the outskirts of Atlanta to the strip joint on the other side of the large town. The long brown wig and makeup adjustment would only fool someone who didn&#x2019;t really know her. Kell would have recognized her in a second, no matter what her disguise.His conversation that morning with her father when he gave his oral report had been telling, though. The bodyguard Dyson was ready to break, if the report he sent in the night before was any indication.Chet Dyson had warned the senator that the situation wasn&#x2019;t working out and his daughter was becoming too confrontational for him to effectively protect her, especially considering that the senator refused to allow Dyson to tell her of the renewed threat. Dyson was getting nervous. It was time to pull him out.Damn, she was good in this traffic. She flipped in front of an eighteen-wheeler with plenty of room to spare but with a move that nearly caught him off guard and kept him from advancing with her.Horns blared and he was sure there were men cursing her from one lane to the next. Men got nervous when a woman drove like that. It made them unpredictable. Few men could handle a woman that aggressive and unpredictable.Kell loved it. The challenge fired his blood and had a smile of anticipation curving his lips. Never had he met a woman whom he found exciting outside the bed. But this one, she would keep a man on his toes well beyond the age where it should be possible. And he had known that since the night she celebrated her eighteenth birthday and turned his little world upside down with a smile.She was a woman who enjoyed life. It sparkled in her eyes and showed in her smile. She was a woman guaran-damn-teed to drive him insane and he wasn&#x2019;t even officially her bodyguard yet. He was just the dumb shit ordered to follow her and her present bodyguard around until gears were put into motion and Durango Team could be rounded up from their various locations. God help him when he had to stay in her home under the cover his commander had informed him he would be using.Because he had lusted after Miss Emily Stanton for seven years. The only thing that had saved her was the fact that he was rarely around her. Living in her home, sleeping under the same roof with her, pretending to be her lover was going to break him and he knew it. Soon, he would have her in his bed; the only battle would be keeping her out of his heart.As he fought to keep up with her in the traffic, Kell found himself cursing along with all the other men in vehicles around them. If he hadn&#x2019;t been trying to follow her, he would have acknowledged her cunning and daring. But he was trying to follow her, and she was making it damned hard to do so.It happened every time he trailed her anywhere. He cussed her for hours. Swore he was going to tie her up and stuff her in a closet. That he would find a nice little uninhabited island to stick her on where she couldn&#x2019;t endanger herself or others.It made a man glad he had a will, even if he didn&#x2019;t have an heir.Who knew an SUV could move like that? He was on his Harley and he couldn&#x2019;t gain the momentum she had on an interstate packed with four lanes of prerush-hour traffic.He was reciting every curse he had learned, in Arabic, in a Middle Eastern prison three years ago. Then he tried the Russian versions that he had learned in a cold little jail in some back mountain province he didn&#x2019;t want to even think about.But he made it, with only inches to spare between the back tire of his precious Harley and a four-by-four pickup as wide as a barn.But he was back in place on her ass, and snarling as she zipped and whipped through the inner-city traffic.Because it was obvious her bodyguard couldn&#x2019;t do a damned thing with her. He wasn&#x2019;t even smart enough to call in backup to contain her. As though backup could do anything with a slippery little fox, he thought with a spurt of amusement.Keeping a careful distance between his Harley and her SUV, he flattened his lips once again and promised himself that the minute he took over her security he was locking her in a room with no escape routes and throwing away the damned key.Then his lips quirked in amusement. Hell no, he wouldn&#x2019;t lock her up. The first thing he was going to do was see how damned fast he could get all that restless fire and passion between the sheets.He had waited long enough for her. She was older now, mature. She could go to bed with him and not be destroyed when it was time for him to walk away.As she pulled into the back lot of a strip club, he amended the previous idea. He wasn&#x2019;t locking her in a room. A room was too good for the hell she was getting ready to put him through when he pulled her out of Timbo&#x2019;s. He was locking her in chains and finding a hole deep enough to contain the little witch. Because sure as hell, if he dragged her out of this place, he was going to end up pissed off, bruised, bloody, and maybe with a few bones broken. And for that, he was going to demand a bit of satisfaction.No, not just a bit. A lot. And likely more than either of them needed. Definitely more than he should be thinking. Because he kept imagining her, not in a hole, but in a bed, her arms stretched over her head, her legs spread, open and inviting. And that lush little body panting for him.Damn, a hard-on sure as hell wasn&#x2019;t what he needed right now.He pulled the Harley into an alley alongside the back parking lot, concealing it behind the trees that struggled to live amid the rot and decay that surrounded them, and watched as Emily and her bodyguard moved from the vehicle.He was going to end up in a fight before this was over with.Not that Kell cared to fight. Hell, he loved to fight. But he didn&#x2019;t think the senator would appreciate the fact that his little girl had been to a strip club, not with the danger facing her now. And the senator wasn&#x2019;t going to be happy either. Kell wondered about Emily&#x2019;s present bodyguard and his obvious lack of sanity.Chet Dyson was a former marine, tough, supposedly fearless, but that was fear Kell saw on his face. Desperation. He was looking around for an escape route, not an attacker, even as he argued with his charge.Kell shook his head. He had heard the other man arguing with her as they left, demanding her keys, threatening to call her father, cursing. But the dumb ass had parked it right in the passenger seat anyway and let Emily have her head.They disappeared in the back door of the strip club and Kell sighed wearily. He was going to have to go in there and find out what the hell she was up to. That was something he had hoped to put off, because knowing the research habits he had uncovered so far, he had a feeling it could be control destroying. It was his luck she was researching the criminal underbelly of Atlanta, a move guaranteed to get her pretty little head shot off her shoulders.Shaking his head, he started the Harley and pulled around to the front lot where he parked it beneath the eagle eye of Timbo&amp;rsqu...</p></p><h2>Charles Manson Now</h2><p>Charles Manson Now is a critical dissection of what happened forty-one years ago when Manson family members stormed the Polanski estate near Los Angeles and murdered five people, including one of America&#39;s most beautiful, beloved actresses, Sharon Tate.This book is also a collage of Charles Manson&#39;s own writing, a poetic, ironic, and disturbing account of his universe, from his childhood to his time in the 8x12 prison cell where he is condemned to stay forever. It is Charles Manson, uncensored, unedited, in his own words.When author Marlin Marynick was eight years old, he discovered a beat up copy of Helter Skelter - the bestselling true crime book of all time written by Vincent Bugliosi, the lead prosecutor at Charles Manson&#39;s trial. Bugliosi&#39;s portrait of Charles Manson as an icon of unbridled evil haunted Marynick for years, well into his career as a psychiatric nurse and ultimately culminated when he met Manson behind the tightly locked doors of California&#39;s Corcoran State Prison. In Charles Manson Now, Marynick challenges the official version of events.</p><p>For the past fifteen years, author Marlin Marynick has been employed as a registered psychiatric nurse in prisons and hospitals. He has worked in many areas of psychiatry with violent offenders and the mentally-ill. Marlin is currently part of the crisis response team in Regina, Saskatchewan.<p>&#x201c;Marlin&#x2019;s soulful search for meaning takes many twists and turns and the reader gets to go along for the fascinating ride.&#x201d;&#x2014;Diane Dimond, Journalist, Special Correspondent for <em>Entertainment Tonight</em></p><p>&#x201c;The psychology student in me says &#x2018;riveting&#x2019;, the victim in me feels &#x2018;compassion&#x2019;.

The hidden history area involves little-known military men and their amazing heroics. The rain engineering sections document the evolution of the technology along with the resulting proof of success the author experienced from around the world. If taken further, this technology could be a tremendous help to humanity. Lastly, the reality of UFOs covers flying, biological creatures that were found to reside in the hidden ultraviolet spectrum of our skies. When witnessed, these beings can be mistaken for unknown craft that are thought to be piloted by humans or aliens rather than being alive in their own right and resident to the earth. The pioneering work of Trevor James Constable is still ahead of its time. The compelling scientific proof presented here leaves little doubt that we have much more to learn about ourselves and the world around us.</p><p></p><h2>Diablo II: Ultimate Strategy Guide</h2><p>In black and white white black and orange covers.

At least, until the night the Carnival comes back... This volume also contains three linked adventures about The Collector, who trades in cryptic experiences at the edges of dreams: a grocery store in the desolate east of New Mexico which houses a collection too disturbing even for him; a marine repository for legendary, long-lost musical recordings; a bakery whose proprietor has developed a dessert a little too tasty for eating. Having circled the globe, the book returns home to conclude with the luminous title story, a meditation on the ways fiction transforms writers and audience alike, inspired by the author&#39;s own performing experiences with the touring ghost story troupe known as The Rolling Darkness Revue. Here, then, is a wanderer&#39;s lament. A ballad of discovery and its costs.

Burns first joined the Nixon administration as an advisor in 1969 and was privy to the dynamics of the president's coterie over the course of six tumultuous years. Now the recently released secret diary of this top-level economist offers a surprisingly candid inside look at Richard Nixon's fall.<br><br>The diary tracks Burns's growing awareness of Nixon's behind-the-scenes maneuverings and worrisome behavior (such as "insane shouting") and reveals how such things undermined his respect and enthusiasm for the president. Perhaps even more telling, Burns's evaluations of his colleagues provide piercing insights into the president's inner circle, including Henry Kissinger ("a brilliant political analyst, but admittedly ignorant of economics"), George Schultz ("a no less confused amateur economist"), John Connally ("a thoroughly confused politician"), and the "vulgarians" H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman&#x2014;the only people he thought Nixon felt relaxed around.<br><br>The Burns diary also offers rare and telling glimpses into the era's economy&#x2014;particularly an account of how Nixon exerted political pressure to shape monetary policies that helped to fuel the stagflation of the 1970s. The administration sought to close the so-called gold window, an approximate valuation of dollars with gold bullion, by floating the dollar, and the consensus over many years has been that Nixon himself arranged this&#x2014;speculation now confirmed by Burns's diary.

The most powerful, glamorous, and respected of all western monarchies had been completely humiliated by England, a country long viewed either as a chaotic backwater or a mere French satellite. The young Edward III's triumph would launch both countries, as we now know, into a grim cycle of some 90 years of further fighting ending with English defeat, but after Cr�cy anything seemed possible&#x2014;Edward's claim to be King of France could be pressed home and, in any event, enormous rewards of land, treasure, and prestige were available both to the king and to the close companions who had made the victory possible. It was to enshrine this moment that Edward created one of the most famous of all knightly orders, the Company of the Garter. Barber writes about both the great campaigns and the individuals who formed the original membership of the Company&#x2014;and through their biographies makes the period tangible and fascinating. This is a book about knighthood, battle tactics, and grand strategy, but it is also about fashion, literature, and the privates lives of everyone from queens to freebooters. Barber's book is a remarkable achievement&#x2014;but also an extremely enjoyable one.</p><p><b>Richard Barber </b>has had a huge influence on the study of medieval history and literature, both as a writer and as a publisher.

In <i>The Indian Traders</i> men like Lorenzo Hubbell&nbsp; of Ganado Trading Post and&nbsp; Thomas Keam, hidden&nbsp; in his canyon, are put into perspective, no longer merely shadowy figures&nbsp; moving through the&nbsp; history of the West.<br><br>In the Southwest, traders like John D. Lee, Thomas Keam, and old Dan DuBois, moving far ahead of the homesteaders, realized their effectiveness as an influence for the Indians' good. While Indian agents often served their own interests&#x2014;financial, religious, or political&#x2014;traders knew that if Indians did not achieve a greater degree of prosperity, traders could never succeed. Whether it was Keam rescuing the Navahos from Agent William F. M. Arny&#x2019;s exploitation and offering his buildings for a Hopi school, Frank Noel mediating their differences with the government, or John B. Moore publicizing and improving Navaho weaving, traders have helped better the lot of Indian artists.<br><br>From the Bents and St. Vrain to modern vendors selling jewelry and groceries to tourists, the traders of New Mexico and Arizona have been the bridge between cultures.

India is very close to becoming the second largest consumer market in the world, with a buying middle class numbering over half a billion. The Indian economy is already the fourth largest in terms of purchasing power parity. It is in the top ten overall GNP. Yet at least 200 million Indians remain desperately poor. Illiteracy rates are high. Communal violence is widespread; corruption endemic. Brides are still tortured and burnt for dowries; female infanticide is common. The caste system has lost little of its power and none of its brutality. How are we to make sense of these apparently contradictory pictures of India today? And how can we overcome the many misconceptions about India that are fed by western stereotypes and Indians&#39; own myths about themselves? Pavan Varma turns a sharply observant gaze on his fellow countrymen to examine what really makes Indians tick. How, for example, does the indifference of most middle-class Indians to the suffering of the poor square with their enthusiasm for parliamentary democracy? How can a people who so supported Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s strategy of non-violence during the struggle for independence burn young brides for their dowries and beat domestic servants near-death? Why do Indians have a reputation for being spiritual and &#39;other-worldly&#39; when their traditions so exalt the pursuit of material well-being as a principal goal of life? Drawing on sources as diverse as ancient Sanskrit treatise and Bollywood lyrics, Pavan Varma creates a vivid and compelling portrait of India and its people. &#34;Being Indian&#34; is an essential book for anyone who wishes to understand Indians, and for Indians who wish to understand themselves.</p><p>A member of the Indian Foreign Service, Pavan K.

That volume ended with the 1970-71 season, just before the arrival of Pierre Boulez as music director.<br>Obviously, much has happened since. This book begins, however, with a retrospective account of the controversial last years of the tenure of Dimitri Mitropoulos and the ascendancy of Leonard Bernstein to the music directorship. Having been a Philharmonic assistant conductor during Bernstein's tenure, and an inveterate Philharmonic watcher ever since, the author brings some personal insights to the story as well as moments of humor.<br>A sub-theme of the book concerns the way the Philharmonic and its music directors have been treated by the New York press, the <i>Times</i> in particular. Howard Taubman's attacks on Mitropoulos, Harold Schonberg's on Bernstein, and Donal Henahan's on Zubin Mehta are all covered here, as are the writings of various critics on those and other conductors, and on the orchestra itself.<br>The New York Philharmonic is the only orchestra ever to undertake a foreign tour solely on the initiative of its musicians, without benefit or support from management. How this came about is chronicled, as are the opening of Lincoln Center, the Parks Concerts, Promenades, Prospective Encounters, Rug Concerts, tours, and, of course, the subscription seasons. John Canarina shows how the New York Philharmonic weathered extraordinary ups and downs during this period, while remaining a vital component of New York's cultural life.</p><p><b>John Canarina</b> (Savannah, GA) is a Juilliard graduate and professor emeritus of Drake University, Des Moines, Iowa, where he was director of orchestral studies from 1973 to 2008.

All raised in Oklahoma during the 1920s and 1930s, these women went on to achieve international fame, each uniquely responsible for changing the image of a ballerina.<br>Lili Cockerille Livingston, who worked with all four of the ballerinas during her own career as a dancer, draws upon her extensive interviews with the women to bring their stories to life. In their own words, they tell about their childhoods in Oklahoma, their early rises to fame, the ups and downs of their personal lives, the challenges of combining marriage and motherhood with a dancing career, and their recent achievements as mentors and teachers of a younger generation of dancers.<br>In tracing the diverse careers of the ballerinas, Livingston fills important gaps in the history of ballet. She sheds new light on the development of New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, and the now-defunct Harkness Ballet and Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas. In addition, she reveals the harshness of touring for dancers, the effect of World War II on the dance world, and revolutionary changes in choreography and training that took place during the women's performing years.<br>Livingston also explores the tribal backgrounds of the women, showing how their rich cultural heritage contributed to their development as artists and their unique performing styles. At the same time she provides a fascinating glimpse into the worlds of the Osage, Choctaw, and Cherokee-Shawnee tribes to which the Tallchief sisters, Hightower, and Chouteau respectively belong.</p><p><i>American Indian Ballerinas</i> includes authorized mini biographies of ballerinas Rosella Hightower, Yvonne Chouteau, Maria Tallchief (who recently published her autobiography), and her sister Marjorie Tallchief. All four dancers share a common ethnicity (Native American) and state of origin (Oklahoma), and all came to prominence at the roughly the same time, the 1940s-1960s--though the four had markedly different temperaments. Without working too hard to compare them, the book shows how their common heritage of dance and spirituality suffused their respective artistic careers.<p><strong>Lili Cockerille Livingston</strong>, who performed with New York City Ballet and was featured in principal roles with both the Harkness and the Joffrey Ballet, is now an independent dance writer living in Tulsa.</p></p><h2>Be Your Own House Contractor: Save 25% Without Lifting a Hammer</h2><p>While building a home is not a simple task, expert Carl Heldmann shows that it is not as complicated as one might believe.

Just in time for the 2008 presidential election-where the future of the Court will be at stake-Toobin reveals an institution at a moment of transition, when decades of conservative disgust with the Court have finally produced a conservative majority, with major changes in store on such issues as abortion, civil rights, presidential power, and church-state relations. Based on exclusive interviews with justices themselves, The Nine tells the story of the Court through personalities-from Anthony Kennedy&#39;s overwhelming sense of self-importance to Clarence Thomas&#39;s well-tended grievances against his critics to David Souter&#39;s odd nineteenth-century lifestyle. There is also, for the first time, the full behind-the-scenes story of Bush v. Gore-and Sandra Day O&#39;Connor&#39;s fateful breach with George W. Bush, the president she helped place in office.

By 1610, however, under Spanish rule it had become one of the best-fortified port cities in the world and an Atlantic center of shipping, commerce, and shipbuilding. Using all available local Cuban sources, Alejandro de la Fuente provides the first examination of the transformation of Havana into a vibrant Atlantic port city and the fastest-growing urban center in the Americas in the late sixteenth century. He shows how local ambitions took advantage of the imperial design and situates Havana within the slavery and economic systems of the colonial Atlantic.<br><br></p><p>"Interest in modern Cuba has deflected scholarly attention away from the early history of the island. This excellent book reopens the history of early Cuba. It is a wonderful and singular re-creation of the history of Havana and of Cuban society based on a meticulous analysis of the earliest extant records. While there is much new here on slavery and commerce, as one would expect, there is also considerable new information on landholding, social organization, mining, and a host of other themes. De la Fuente's book will change our understanding of how the Hispanic Caribbean and the early Atlantic world developed.

She lives in Hawaii.A vivid biography of Britain's longest-reigning monarch, with an emphasis on the queen's personal life. When the inexperienced, dowdy Princess Victoria ascended to the throne in 1837, few people expected her to reign until 1901 or to give her name to an entire age. Reconstructing such homely matters as Victoria's daily routines with her dogs, her children, and her servants, veteran biographer Erickson (To the Scaffold: The Life of Marie Antoinette, 1991, etc.) overcomes the remoteness and abstraction of textbook history to demonstrate that Victoria was in some ways very un-Victorian. She had a passionate sex life with her husband, Albert. Although she believed that women had little place outside the home, she played an active, even aggressive role in public life, especially in foreign affairs. However, Erickson does not appear to recognize the dangers of identifying too closely with her subject. Victoria's attitude to her working-class subjects was a mixture of contempt, fear, and romantic idealization. She gloried in her elevation to the title of empress of India, but the Indian people were either unrealistically idealized for their spirituality or furiously vilified as the fiendish murderers of white women and children during the Mutiny of 1857. Victoria's narrow view of the world had important political consequences that Erickson ignores, notably in the case of Ireland. By her stubborn opposition to political rights for the Irish, Victoria helped to block the far-sighted attempt by her prime minister, William Gladstone, to grant them greater autonomy. The consequences of that failure have been tragic. Although a useful introduction to the details of everyday life among the upper classes, this is an unreliable guide to the broader issues of 19th-century British and imperial history.

Englade (A Family Business, 1992, etc.) shuffles the usual suspects and motivations here (greed, a woman scorned, etc.). In 1983, he tells us, one Joy Aylor (a.k.a. Jodie Packer, Leigh Curry, Stephanie Grimes, etc.) discovered that her husband, Larry (owner of a successful Dallas house-building firm), had been sleeping with beautiful, young Rozanne Borghi Gailiunas--the wife of family friend Peter Gailiunas, a successful Dallas physician. Joy put out a contract on Rozanne and soon the woman was found naked, tied to bedposts, shot, strangled, and very dead. It took the cops five years to nail the killer: The man whom Joy contracted to do the deed--Dallas auto-mechanic Brian Lee Kreafle--had, it seems, subcontracted the killing to one Andy Hopper, manager of an auto- body shop. When finally caught, Hopper confessed and was convicted of capital murder. Meanwhile, in 1986, Joy shelled out $12,000 to have Larry murdered because he was now sleeping with her younger sister. The attempted hit failed, although three .22 bullets went through the cab of Larry's truck, one hitting a friend in the elbow. Finally, in 1991, Joy, who fled the country, was snagged in the south of France. Today, she awaits trial in Texas on conspiracy charges. So overcomplicated that Englade includes a dramatis personae and a ``Chronology of Major Events''--but readers may still get lost wending through his labyrinthine, lackluster account. (Eight pages of b&amp;w photographs) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Englade ( Beyond Reason ) here treats a complex Dallas murder case with a master's touch. In 1983, Rozanne Gailiunas, mistress of contractor Larry Aylor, was found murdered in her home. No killer was identified and Aylor and Joy, his wife of 15 years, were reconciled. In 1986, as the couple was again considering divorcing, Larry was ambushed near his remote ranch, but managed to escape. No one was charged. Then in 1988, Joy's sister Carol, claiming that her own life was in danger, gave the police information that brought about the arrests of Joy and Carol's estranged husband Bill for Rozanne's murder and the attempt on Larry's life. The investigation also led to an ex-ministerial student, Andy Hopper, who confessed that Joy hired him to kill Rozanne. Much of the book is devoted to Hopper's trial, in which he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Two brothers confessed to the attempted murder of Larry, also financed by Joy, and they are now in prison. Joy, out on bail, fled to France, where she is being held pending extradition. Another five people--including Carol and her husband--have been charged with related crimes in this web of blackmail and hired killers, though they have yet to be tried.

Widely praised upon its initial release, it was described as "meticulously researched and persuasively argued" by the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>.<br><br>Historian David Williams has written the first account of the American Civil War though the eyes of ordinary people&#x2014;foot soldiers, slaves, women, prisoners of war, draft resisters, Native Americans, and others.

In so doing it recovers the long-overlooked perspectives and forgotten voices of one of the defining chapters of American history. Forty b/w images.</p><p><b>David Williams</b> is the author of <i>Plain Folk in a Rich Man's War, Johnny Reb's War</i>, and <i>Rich Man's War</i>. He is a professor of history at Valdosta State University in Valdosta, Georgia, where he lives.A reconsideration of the Civil War that addresses its impact on ordinary people. Williams (History/Valdosta State Univ.; Plain Folk in a Rich Man&#39;s War, 2002, etc.) argues that the war was created by monied elites in the North and South looking to maximize profits. Working men and women widely opposed the war from its inception. Williams offers evidence of strong opposition to secession among poor Southerners, who owned few slaves and stood to gain little from independence. Nor did Northern workers support a war to free the slaves, whom they saw as competition for their jobs; Lincoln&#39;s delay in endorsing emancipation was primarily intended to defuse opposition to the war among his own citizens. War fervor declined rapidly after the initial battles, and both sides were forced to institute conscription-with ample loopholes for the wealthy. That led to the popular byword, &#34;rich man&#39;s war, poor man&#39;s fight,&#34; which becomes Williams&#39;s mantra. It also led to draft riots and armed rebellion on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. Desertion was also a problem-Robert E. Lee blamed his loss at Antietam primarily on defection from the ranks of his army. By war&#39;s end, over half the Confederate army was AWOL. Many had gone home to families whose inability to feed themselves was largely caused by the rich planters&#39; decision to raise lucrative cotton and tobacco instead of food crops. Women often took matters into their own hands, launching raids on food depots and funneling aid to deserters and draft dodgers. Meanwhile, slave revolts and Indian wars on the western frontiers divided the attention of both sides. At times, it seems a wonder either side managed to win-and at war&#39;s end, the same old monied elites remained in control in the North and the South. A useful, if sometimes depressing, counter to the sanitized picture many historians paint of our nation&#39;s greatest struggle.

No such luck, though, as the Empress herself sent him on a secret mission to stop the nanite plague, but an enemy had somehow convinced the Imperial Fleet that he was actually a wanted criminal, so after a battle leaving his ship in urgent need of repairs all three of them joined an interstellar traveling circus (don&#x2019;t ask!) in order to save the galaxy once again (as told in <i>The Wizard of Karres</i>). <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time for a vacation?

Thompson (1937-2005) developed a style of writing about American life and politics that was so acerbic and over-the-top, it earned its own nickname: &#x201c;gonzo journalism.&#x201d; His magazine articles and books&#x2015;of which he penned nearly a dozen, including Hell&#x2019;s Angels, The Rum Diary, Songs of the Doomed, The Great Shark Hunt, and the monumental Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#x2015;influenced a generation of writers and established his voice as an essential part of America&#x2019;s socio-political fabric. Portrayed on the silver screen by Bill Murray (Where the Buffalo Roam, 1980) and Johnny Depp (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, 1998), Thompson was a wild character whose persona was inseparable from his often semi-autobiographical writing. True to his image, he once said, &#x201c;I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they&#x2019;ve always worked for me.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Losing Battle With Islam</h2><p>In this comprehensive study of the Islamic revival from 1947 to the present, historian David Selbourne traces in detail the complex causes motivating the rise of Muslim fundamentalism in many countries and the West&#39;s largely uncomprehending response to it. He frankly describes the hostilities, cruelties, and errors of judgment on both sides.Writing neither from the &#34;left&#34; nor from the &#34;right,&#34; Selbourne pieces together up-to-date information from more numerous sources than in any other work on the subject. He highlights the grotesque role that some sections of the Western media have played and seeks to do justice to the Islamist cause, demonstrating how many of the real issues of the Islamic revival have been evaded.Selbourne argues that whether the &#34;reawakening&#34; of the Islamic and Arab worlds has taken the political form of Arab nationalism, as under the leadership of Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser in the 1950s, or the economic form of the OPEC oil embargo in 1973 and 1974, or the religious form of the Iranian revolution of 1989 and the present al-Qaeda suicide squads, in all its guises it is motivated by a sense of entitlement in Muslims to determine their own destiny free of Western subordination.Selbourne concludes with a warning against the illusions of the West about its superiority and ability to contain a force that is confident of its own moral superiority and certain of its ultimate triumph.Addressed both to general readers and to policy makers, academics, and journalists, The Losing Battle with Islam will stand for some time as one of the most impartial and authoritative accounts of a half century of Western conflict with Islam.</p><p><b>David Selbourne</b> is a historian who taught for two decades at Ruskin College, Oxford, the college of the British labour movement.

Charles Dickens The golden age of fairy painting lasted between 1840-1870 when fairies found expression in most of the Victorian arts - paintings, illustration, literature, theatre, ballet and music. The Victorians wanted desperately to believe in fairies because they represented a way to escape the intolerable reality of living in an unromantic, materialistic and scientific age. Fairy painting had a strong literary background. The books of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen perfected the Victorian consciousness. Shakespeare was an even more important source in particular with The Tempest and A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream. Another influence was the Victorian obsession with the supernatural, spiritualism and the unseen world.</p><p></p><h2>Home of the Brave (Raine Stockton Dog Mystery)</h2><p>Raine Stockton and her high-spirited, big-hearted golden retriever Cisco are accustomed to being heroes wherever they go.

Many have argued that the attack was a brilliant Japanese military coup, or a failure of U.S. intelligence agencies, or even a conspiracy of the Roosevelt administration. But despite the attention historians have paid to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the truth about that fateful day has remained a mystery until now. In <i>Operation Snow: How a Soviet Mole in FDR&#x2019;s White House Triggered Pearl Harbor</i>, author John Koster uses recently declassified evidence and never-before-translated documents to tell the real story of the day that FDR memorably declared would live in infamy, forever. <i>Operation Snow</i> shows how Joseph Stalin and the KGB used a vast network of double-agents and communist sympathizers most notably, Harry Dexter White to lead Japan into war against the United States, demonstrating incontestable Soviet involvement behind the bombing of Pearl Harbor. A thrilling tale of espionage, mystery and war, <i>Operation Snow</i> will forever change the way we think about Pearl Harbor and World War II.</p><p><b> Praise for <i>Operation Snow</i></b><br>?I found <i>Operation Snow</i> to be an irresistible page-turner. The attack exacted a terrible toll on both countries and changed the world forever. It is important to understand why that happened.

In Wade in the Water , Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Tracy K. Smith&#39;s signature voice - inquisitive, lyrical and wry - turns over what it means to be a citizen, a mother and an artist in a culture arbitrated by wealth, men and violence. The various connotations of the title, taken from a spiritual once sung on the Underground Railroad which smuggled slaves to safety in 19th-century America, resurface throughout the book, binding past and present together. Collaged voices and documents recreate both the correspondence between slave owners and the letters sent home by African Americans enlisted in the US Civil War. Survivors&#39; reports attest to the experiences of recent immigrants and refugees. Accounts of near-death experiences intertwine with the modern-day fallout of a corporation&#39;s illegal pollution of a major river and the surrounding land; and, in a series of beautiful lyrical pieces, the poet&#39;s everyday world and the growth and flourishing of her daughter are observed with a tender and witty eye. Marrying the contemporary and the historical to a sense of the transcendent, haunted and holy, this is a luminous book by one of America&#39;s essential poets.</p><p>Tracy K. Smith is the author of three previous poetry collections, including Life on Mars, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and a memoir, Ordinary Light, which was a finalist for the National Book Award.

The huge, insectlike machines, "made of iron-coated giants' bones, chains, pulleys, dagger-fingers and -toes, and a long whiplike tail," feed on the souls of dead children and are systematically killing off the citizens and warriors of Tortall. <p> Thoroughly disgusted to discover that not only is she not going to be assigned a combat post, but she has been placed in charge of a refugee camp instead, Kel, in her usual noble, stoic way, swallows her disappointment and sets out being the best refugee camp commander possible.

When The Professor, a man of enormous intellect and appetite, takes The Kid under his wing, his own startling past will cause upheavals in both of their worlds.

Known in his new identity only as the Kid, and on probation after doing time for a liaison with an underage girl, he is shackled to a GPS monitoring device and forbidden to live within 2,500 feet of anywhere children might gather. With nowhere else to go, the Kid takes up residence under a south Florida causeway, in a makeshift encampment with other convicted sex offenders.</p><p>Barely beyond childhood himself, the Kid, despite his crime, is in many ways an innocent, trapped by impulses and foolish choices he himself struggles to comprehend. Enter the Professor, a man who has built his own life on secrets and lies. A university sociologist of enormous size and intellect, he finds in the Kid the perfect subject for his research on homelessness and recidivism among convicted sex offenders. The two men forge a tentative partnership, the Kid remaining wary of the Professor&#x2019;s motives even as he accepts the counsel and financial assistance of the older man.</p><p>When the camp beneath the causeway is raided by the police, and later, when a hurricane all but destroys the settlement, the Professor tries to help the Kid in practical matters while trying to teach his young charge new ways of looking at, and understanding, what he has done. But when the Professor&#x2019;s past resurfaces and threatens to destroy his carefully constructed world, the balance in the two men&#x2019;s relationship shifts.</p><p>Suddenly, the Kid must reconsider everything he has come to believe, and choose what course of action to take when faced with a new kind of moral decision.</p><p>Long one of our most acute and insightful novelists, Russell Banks often examines the indistinct boundaries between our intentions and actions. A mature and masterful work of contemporary fiction from one of our most accomplished storytellers, <em>Lost Memory of Skin</em> unfolds in language both powerful and beautifully lyrical, show-casing Banks at his most compelling, his reckless sense of humor and intense empathy at full bore.</p><p>The perfect convergence of writer and subject, <em>Lost Memory of Skin</em> probes the zeitgeist of a troubled society where zero tolerance has erased any hope of subtlety and compassion&#x2014;a society where isolating the offender has perhaps created a new kind of victim. </p></p><h2>Backstairs Billy: The Life of William Tallon, the Queen Mother&#39;s Most Devoted Servant</h2><p><p>One of the nation's best kept secrets, life behind the gates of Buckingham Palace is subject to worldwide speculation.

But such names, and the characteristics associated with them, come to us from outside observers &#x2013; Greek and Roman writers &#x2013; rather than from their own words. To understand how late prehistoric groups constructed and expressed their identities, the author examines the rich archaeological evidence left by the Iron Age Europeans themselves. Recent theoretical and methodological advances in anthropology, archaeology and history, together with results of archaeological research all over Europe, provide the basis for a new approach to the problem of the identities of Iron Age peoples. Peter Wells uses patterns of identity revealed in the archaeology to interpret the commentaries of Greek and Roman authors who conveyed their own perceptions of these non-literate groups. Finally, he examines ways in which Iron Age Europeans responded to the Greek and Roman representations of them.

Original.</p><p>Grade 8 Up-An accomplished fantasy author has extended the popular world of "Warcraft" (S &amp; S) into manga. This first volume opens with eight pages of back story. Readers meet Kalec, a blue dragon who can shapeshift into a young man and who is being pursued by a band of dwarves. He nearly dies from their missiles, but Anveena, a local peasant girl, finds him and brings him home. Thus begins a quest of sorts, marred by derivative writing and formulaic plots. When her parents see their daughter with a strange, wounded man with shredded clothes, they inexplicably call out, "Hello, what's your name?" Their faces never change from huge grins, even as they're about to be murdered. Anveena then goes along with Kalec, who is engaged to another woman. It's hard to imagine that this title will appeal to any but the least discerning "<i>Warcraft</i>" devotee, given the huge gaps in logic and absurd action. Why build intelligent, dramatic tension when each moment of crisis can end with some new character swooping in with a huge monologue to deliver? Also, the illustrations, while appropriately grotesque, seem unpolished and amateurish. A final scene with an undead army is built up as an epic battle, but ends with someone saying, "Is that all?" A fan base alone may not be enough of a consideration for purchase when a title has so little to recommend it.<i>-John Leighton, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.From the world of the incredibly popular Warcraft online role-playing game comes this first manga of a trilogy. The war-torn world of Azeroth is plagued on all sides by evil dragons, power-hungry elves and the armies of the Undead Scourge. Just as a wary peace seems possible, the Sunwell, a source of unimaginable power previously thought to be lost, resurfaces. Kalec, a blue dragon who takes an appealing human form complete with Farrah Fawcett hair, is on a quest to prevent the Sunwell's destructive power from being realized. He is joined by Anveena, a quaint country girl with a world-changing secret. Together they encounter the stock set of fantasy characters: surly dwarves, stupid orcs, rugged warriors and beautiful maidens. There's betrayal, magic and, of course, pages and pages of sword fights. The backstory for the Warcraft world is so complicated it requires eight pages of prose to explain it in brief, and still much of the comic is spent on exposition. This volume manages to be incomprehensibly complicated and yet at the same time insipidly transparent. The art is attractive and easily digested, but the characters and plot are purely cookie-cutter creations. This work will please only hardcore fans of the game. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Taking a shrewd look at the high-tech boom and its aftermath, Malkiel shows how to maximize gains and minimize losses in this era of electronic brokers, virtual gurus, and flashy investment vehicles. Learn how to analyze the potential returns, not only for stocks and bonds, but for the full range of investment opportunities, from money market accounts and real estate investment trusts to insurance, home owning, and tangible assets like gold and collectibles. Decode the rating game for mutual funds and discover the unique advantages of index mutual funds over the wide range of riskier alternatives. Year in and year out the best investing guide money can buy, this enhanced edition includes an update of Malkiel's famous "Life-Cycle Guide to Investing," showing how to match an investment strategy to your stage in life.</p><p>It's unlikely that you'll spot many dog-eared copies of <i>A Random Walk</i> floating amongst the Wall Street set (although bookshelves at home may prove otherwise). After all, a "random walk"--in market terms--suggests that a "blindfolded monkey" would have as much luck selecting a portfolio as a pro. But Burton Malkiel's classic investment book is anything but random. Since stock prices cannot be predicted in the short term, argues Malkiel, individual investors are better off buying and holding onto index funds than meddling with securities or actively managing mutual funds. Not only will a broad range of index funds outperform a professionally managed portfolio in the long run, but investors can avoid expense charges and trading costs, which decrease returns.<p> First published in 1973, this seventh printing of a <i>A Random Walk</i> looks forward and does so broadly, examining a new range of investment choices facing the turn-of-the-century investor: money-market accounts, tax-exempt funds, Roth IRAs, and equity REITs, as well as the potential benefits and pitfalls of the emerging global economy. In his updated "life-cycle guide to investing," Malkiel offers age-related investment strategies that consider one's <i>capacity</i> for risk. (A 30-year-old who can depend on wages to offset investment losses has a different risk capacity from a 60-year-old.) In his assessment of rocketing Internet stocks, Malkiel defends his "random" position well, explaining how "the market eventually corrects any irrationality--albeit in its own slow, inexorable fashion. Anomalies can crop up, markets can get irrationally optimistic, and often they attract unwary investors. But eventually, true value is recognized by the market, and this is the main lesson investors must heed." Written for the financial layperson but bolstered by 30 years of research, <i>A Random Walk</i> will help individual investors take charge of their financial future.

Just ask Detective Meredith Folger, who wants to know why somebody would've killed newly returned Rusty Mason--who took off for Brazil ten years ago one jump ahead of a sealed indictment--and why he would've risked his freedom to come back in the first place. The deeper she digs, though, the more dirt she finds. The resourceful Rusty was blackmailing his kid brother Peter, off-islanders Schuyler Tate-Jackson (Peter's lawyer) and Mayling Stern (Sky's dress-designer girlfriend), and whoever else was implicated in his own mysterious crime back in 1982, just before his father narrowly survived a takeover bid for the family business and then succumbed to a fatal heart attack.

There ensued a long series of struggles between his generals and governors for control of these territories. Most of these Diadochi (Successors) were consummate professionals who had learnt the art of war under Alexander or even his father, Philip. Few died a peaceful death and the last survivors of this tough breed were still leading their armies against each other well into their seventies.<br><br>Colorful characters, epic battles, treachery and subterfuge make this a period with great appeal to anyone interested in ancient history and ancient warfare in particular. The wars shaped the map from the Balkans to India for the next couple of centuries.<br><br>This first volume introduces the key personalities - characters such as Antigonos 'Monopthalmus' (the One-eyed) and his son 'Demetrius 'Poliorcetes' (the Besieger), Seleucus 'Nicator' ('the Victorious') and Ptolemy 'Soter' ('the Saviour') - and gives a narrative of the causes and course of these wars from the death of Alexander to the Battle of Corupedium (281 BC) when the last two original Diadochi faced each other one final time.</p><p>Bob Bennett has a Certificate in British Archaeology and an MA in Classical Studies from the Open University.

And how does doing these things in relation to God differ from when we do them in relation to other people? And what does this entail for the existence and nature of the God to whom we pray?This revised and extended edition of Vincent Brummer&#39;s classic book on prayer published in 1984, provides a comprehensive philosophical analysis of central issues associated with the nature and practice of prayer. Serving as a valuable core text for students, this book also contributes to a number of current debates in theology and philosophy of religion: the debate on realism and religious belief, the debate on the rationality of faith and the nature of theology, the debate on the relation between religious belief and morality, the debate on the relation between science and religion and the lively debate among evangelical Christians in America on the &#39;openness of God&#39;.This new edition adds significantly to the current academic interest in spirituality with three newly written chapters showing that arguments in the book have important implications for the nature of spirituality, of faith and religious belief, and of theology. Spirituality is not aimed at achieving religious &#39;experiences&#39; or mystical &#39;knowledge&#39; about God; it is primarily aimed at attaining the religious form of life and at coming to see the world in the light of faith. Religious belief is not merely a cognitive enterprise like science; it cannot be divorced from spirituality and the life of faith, and is therefore fundamentally existential and not merely intellectual.</p><p>Vincent Brummer is Emeritus Professor in the Philosophy of Religion at the University of Utrecht, The Netherlands.</p><h2>Louise, The Adventures of a Chicken</h2><p><p>She longed for adventure. </p><p>So she left her home and ventured out into the wide world.</p><p>The pleasures and perils she met proved plentiful: marauding pirates on the majestic seas, a ferocious lion under the bright lights of the big top, a mysterious stranger in an exotic and bustling bazaar.</p><p>Yet in the face of such daunting danger, our heroine . . .</p><p>She was brave.</p><p>She was fearless.</p><p>She was feathered.</p><p>She was a chicken.</p><p>A not-so-chicken chicken.</p><p>Her name?</p></p><p><p>She longed for adventure. </p> <p>So she left her home and ventured out into the wide world.</p> <p>The pleasures and perils she met proved plentiful: marauding pirates on the majestic seas, a ferocious lion under the bright lights of the big top, a mysterious stranger in an exotic and bustling bazaar.</p> <p>Yet in the face of such daunting danger, our heroine . . .</p> <p>She was brave.</p> <p>She was fearless.</p> <p>She was feathered.</p> <p>She was a chicken.</p> <p>A not-so-chicken chicken.</p> <p>Her name?</p> <p> <strong>A Look Inside <i>Louise: The Adventures of a Chicken</i></strong> <b>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</b><br> </p><p></p><p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Louise Meets Some Pirates</td> <td>Louise Meets a Fortune Teller</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong>Questions for Kate DiCamillo</strong> </p><p> </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> Tell us about Louise--how is she so brave? What do you do when you&#x2019;re feeling a little bit chicken? </p><p><b>Kate Dicamillo:</b> When I think of Louise, the words that come to mind are insouciant and unflappable. I suppose that when all is said and done, she is brave. But she's also kind of, um, *clueless.* As for me, when I am feeling afraid, I squawk and flap my wings and run around in circles and then I go ahead and try to do the thing that I'm pretty sure I can't do. </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> I know pirates don't keep very good records, but have you found any historical evidence of chickens adventuring with pirates? </p><p><b>Dicamillo:</b> Yes, it's true, pirates don't keep great records. But there are several diaries of chickens that have survived through the ages and they paint a quite colorful (and detailed (and sometimes horrifiying)) picture of the many adventures that chickens have had with pirates. I refererred to these diaries when I was doing my research. They were written in chicken scratch; it was slow going. </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> If Louise, Despereaux, and Mercy Watson went on an adventure together, what do you think would happen? </p><p><b>Dicamillo:</b> Wow, there's a picture . . . let's see. I can envision Louise standing on Mercy's back and Despereaux perched on Louise's head. *Anything* could happen, I suppose. And would. But I'm sure that whatever happened, it would involve toast, hot air balloons, cluelessness and Despereaux ultimately saving the day. </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> This is your first collaboration with Harry Bliss. Did you have his style in mind when you wrote the story, or did you join up with him afterward? </p><p><b>Dicamillo:</b> When I wrote Louise, I didn't have a particular illustrator in mind. But the chicken (the whole world!) that Harry has brought to life in this book has delighted and humbled me. He's a genius. </p><p><b>Amazon.com:</b> You've written award-winning books for kids of every age. Do you tell a different kind of story for each age, or do you think all kids find the same elements appealing? </p><p><b>Dicamillo:</b> I don't think about what age the story is for or who or why.

It looks at 30 leading links and course, from the magnificent natural surroundings of Portmarnock and Portrush, developed almost 100 years ago, to the more recent parkland courses of Mount Juliet and Kildare Hotel and Country Club. Each course is discussed in detail, telling its history, of the famous players with which it is associated, and, of course, some of the legends: like the goats at Lahinch which doubled as weather forecasters; or the player at Killarney in 1957 who sliced a ball into the lake and killed a trout tht was rising to a fly; or Eric Fiddian, who in 1932, had two holes in one in the final round of the Irish Open Amateur Championship and lost his match.</p><p>John Redmond is a former golf correspondent and Group Sports News Editor with Irish Press Newspapers.

By the author of Frida Kahlo: The Paintings. National ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Sympathetic bio-critical study of the French painter once savaged for his radical style. The most intriguing thing about Matisse was his bourgeois life, which included law school, a family (with kids), and--after some years of searing poverty--mounds of money: Hardly the background one expects of a man who, for a time, was perceived as Picasso's equal in the creation of modern art and was portrayed as an artistic terrorist or pervert by critics on both sides of the Atlantic. But, as art historian Herrera (Frida, 1983, etc.) points out, Matisse did indeed shock with his early canvases, especially in 1905, when he invented Fauvism, with its garish tints and barbaric strokes. Matisse enjoyed the limelight until Picasso left him in the dust by developing cubism, whose geometric forms were so unlike Matisse's color-oriented canvases. For the next three or four decades, Matisse led a successful artist's life, devising a simplified, decorator's style ``radiant with Mediterranean sunlight.'' His paintings were also steeped with eroticism; Matisse liked to put one hand on his nude model's knee as he painted with the other. In his last years, a burst of creativity with colored- paper cut-outs led to new accolades and did nothing to hurt his reputation as a feel-good artist (a description Matisse wouldn't have minded, since he believed that his paintings could cure disease). As Herrera explains, Matisse's family and friends continue to keep his private life under wraps. This leads to a study thick with surface details (many of the paintings are closely described) but too shallow to encompass the inner currents. (Twenty-eight color, 80 b&amp;w illustrations--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Matisse was confined by neither the academy nor the dogma of Neo-Impressionism but was instead rooted in his senses and in the sensuality of paint that is so much the focus of his art. Herrera ( Frida Kahlo: The Paintings , LJ 5/15/92; Mary Frank , Abrams, 1990) tells the story of the much-admired genius in this illustrated critical biography. The author demonstrates Matisse's progression from Fauvism to individual expression, illuminating some significant paintings along the way. She also explores the role of the artist's family in various creations: portraying the relationship with a doubtful but supporting father; examining Matisse's use of his wife and children as art models; and describing some pretty tortured times in France during both world wars. Herrera acknowledges more extensive books by Jack Flam, Lawrence Gowing, Nicholas Watkins, and John Russell, among others, in a bibliographic note; although she is breaking no new ground, comprehensive collections will want this book as a well-chosen window from which to observe the artist.<br><i>- Ellen Bates, New York</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lady Cottington&#39;s Pressed Fairy Book: 10 3/4 Anniversary Edition</h2><p>In 1995 <i>Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book</i> was released to an unsuspecting public.

Kit Tyler is marked by suspicion and disapproval from the moment she arrives on the unfamiliar shores of colonial Connecticut in 1687. Alone and desperate, she has been forced to leave her beloved home on the island of Barbados and join a family she has never met. Kit&#39;s unconventional background and high-spirited ways immediately clash with the Puritanical lifestyle of her uncle&#39;s household, and despite her best efforts to adjust, it seems Kit will never win the favour of those around her. Torn between her quest for belonging and her desire to be true to herself, Kit struggles to survive in a hostile place, and just when it seems she must give up, she finds a kindred spirit. But Kit&#39;s friendship with old Hannah Tupper, who is believed by the colonists to be a witch, proves more taboo than she could have imagined, and ultimately Kit is forced to choose between her heart and her duty. Elizabeth George Speare&#39;s Newbery Medal-winning novel portrays the life of a girl uprooted from her birthplace and yet unbound by the suppression of her new home, a heroine whom readers will admire for her unwavering sense of truth as well as her infinite capacity to love.</p><p>Forced to leave her sunny Caribbean home for the bleak Connecticut Colony, Kit Tyler is filled with trepidation. As they sail up the river to Kit's new home, the teasing and moodiness of a young sailor named Nat doesn't help. Still, her unsinkable spirit soon bobs back up. What this spirited teenager doesn't count on, however, is how her aunt and uncle's stern Puritan community will view her. In the colonies of 1687, a girl who swims, wears silk and satin gowns, and talks back to her elders is not only headstrong, she is in grave danger of being regarded as a witch. When Kit befriends an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond, it is more than the ascetics can take: soon Kit is defending her life. Who can she count on as she confronts these angry and suspicious townspeople? <p> A thoroughly exciting and rewarding Newbery Medal winner and ALA Notable Children's Book, Elizabeth George Speare's <i>The Witch of Blackbird Pond</i> brings this frightening period of witch hysteria to life. Readers will wonder at the power of the mob mentality, and the need for communities in desperate times--even current times--to find a scapegoat.

He had been murdered by a homosexual prostitute, but it is possible that the murder was in fact politically motivated. This is a study of one of the most remarkable Italian writers and artists since World War II. Pasolini first earned national attention as a poet trying to resolve Christian and Marxist ideology; later, he made his own homosexuality a subject of his poetry and two of his famous novels explored the rough world of Roman youth. In the 1960s he began making movies which include &#34;The Gospel According to Saint Matthew&#34;, &#34;Teorema&#34;, &#34;The Decameron&#34;, &#34;The Canterbury Tales&#34; and &#34;Salo&#34;. In this study, Siciliano discusses Pasolini&#39;s life and work, his early years and homosexual experience; the literary and political controversies, the scandals and the court trials; his love affairs and his friendships with such people as Alberto Moravia, Elsa Moravia and Maria Callas.</p><p>Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>How to design &amp; build energy-efficient fireplaces &amp; chimneys</h2><p>Hardcover: 383 pages Publisher: Tab Books; First Edition edition (1981) Language: English ISBN-10: 0830696946 ISBN-13: 978-0830696949 Package Dimensions: 8.4 x 5.3 x 2.1 inches Shipping Weight: 2 pounds</p><p></p><h2>Articulate Silences: Hisaye Yamamoto, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Joy Kogewa (Reading Women Writing)</h2><p><p>In this pathbreaking book, King-Kok Cheung sheds new light on the thematic and rhetoncal uses of silence in fiction by three Asian American women: Hisaye Yamamoto, Maxine Hong Kingston, and JoyKogawa. Boldly articulating the unspeakable, these writers break the silence imposed by families or ethnic communities and defy the dominant culture that suppresses the voicing of minority experiences. Yet at the same time, they demonstrate how silences&#x2015;voiceless gestures, textual ellipses, authorial hesitations&#x2015;can themselves be articulate. Drawing on theoretical works on women's writing, on ethnicity and race, and on postmodernism and history, Cheung takes issue with Anglo-American feminists who valorize speech unequivocally and with revisionist Asian American male critics who attempt to refute Orientalist stereotypes by renouncing silence. She challenges Eurocentric views of speech and silence as polarized, hierarchical, and gendered, and proposes an approach to Asian American literature which overturns the "East-West" or "dual personality" model. Yamamoto, Kingston, and Kogawa interweave speech and silence, narration and ellipses, autobiography and fiction as they adapt and recast Asian and Euro-American precursors. Drawing freely from both traditions, they reinvent the past by decentering, disseminating, and interrogating authority-but not by reappropriating it. A fresh and subtle response to issues relating to cultural diversity, <i>Articulate Silences</i> will be important reading for scholars and students in the fie,4s of literary theory and criticism, women's studies, Asian American studies, and ethnic studies.</p></p><p><p>King-Kok Cheung is Associate Professor of English at UCLA. She received her Ph.D. degree in English from the University of California, Berkeley. She is also the author of <i>Asian American Literature: An Annotated Bibliography</i>.</p><p>"The equation of silence and passivity, and the stereotypical ascription of those characteristics onto Asian Americans has long plagued the lives of Asians in America.... Cheung challenges and effectively deconstructs this stereotype by complicating the very notion of silence as represented in the work of writers Hisaye Yamamoto, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Joy Kogawa.... In this challenge to Eurocentric and simplistic celebrations of speech over silence, King-kok Cheung has opened up diverse avenues of study with unlimited potential for further examination and theorization that will surely move Asian American studies into new and productive directions."</p> (Kandice Chuh <i>International Examiner Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br><p>"King-Kok Cheung's <i>Articulate Silences</i> remains a persuasive, gracefully written, and timely study. Her meticulous and insightful close readings will go a long way toward establishing the craftsmanship of Asian American writers, which unfortunately is still grossly underappreciated."</p> (San-Ling Cynthia Wong, University of California Berkeley <i>American Quarterly</i>)</p><h2>Ellen White Comments on the Crisis Ahead: Answers to Questions About the End-Time</h2><p>What if you could sit down with Ellen White and ask her any question you wished about the end of the world? Now you can, in a way. Her inspired insights into last-day events have been arranged in a systematic sequence as answers to simple questions posed by Robert W. Olson. In this book Ellen White explains not only WHAT will happen, but HOW to get ready for it. Why has Jesus not returned before now? How and when will Satan impersonate Christ? What signs will attend the shaking, loud dry, latter rain, time of trouble, and close of probation? What prophecies have yet to be fulfilled? What about miracles in the last days? Scripture predicts that the world will end neither with a bang nor a whimper, but with the glorious revelation of its Creator. In these pages God calls us to prepare for the final crisis by living consecrated lives that reflect His coming triumph over evil.</p><p></p><h2>King Henry VIII</h2><p><p><i>King Henry VIII</i> has one of the fullest theatrical histories of any play in the Shakespeare canon, yet has been consistently misrepresented, both in performance and in criticism. This edition offers a new perspective on this ironic, multi-layered, collaborative play, revealing it as a complex meditation on the progress of Reformation which sees English life since Henry VIII's day as a series of bewildering changes in national and personal allegiance and represents "history" as the product of varied and contradictory testimony. McMullan makes a powerful claim for the rehabilitation of <i>Henry VIII</i>, providing the fullest performance history of any edition to date and reading the work not as a marginal "late" Shakespeare play but as a play which is paradigmatic of the achievement of Renaissance drama as a whole. His introduction emphasizes truth and conscience and the dramatic devices used to portray these themes. This edition's appendices elucidate the chronology for the events portrayed in <i>King Henry VIII</i> and other source works. A scene from Beaumont and Fletcher's <i>A Maid's Tragedy</i>, comments on music, a doubling chart, and other reference information are also included.</p><p><b>The Arden Shakespeare</b> has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play's foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information.

Publishers Weekly</p><h2>The All Jahdu Storybook</h2><p>Virginia Hamilton has once again brought her well-loved trickster, the invisible Jahdu, to life in this updated collection of eleven previously published, and four newly created, stories. Jahdu is based on a centuries-old folklore tradition, yet the tales themselves are original and drawn from Hamilton&#x2019;s imagination. &#x201c;The language is vigorous and masterfully honed, while the character of lively, powerful, self-defining Jahdu has appeal.&#x201d;--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br></p><p>VIRGINIA HAMILTON (1936&#x2013;2002) was one of the most highly acclaimed writers of her time. Her many awards included the National Book Award, the John Newbery Medal, the Coretta Scott King Award (twice), the <i>Boston Globe</i>-Horn Book Award (twice), the Edgar Allan Poe Award, the Ohioana Book Award, and two of her novels were cited as Newbery Honor Books. She was a Distinguished Visiting Professor at Queen College and the Ohio State University. Ms. Hamilton was married to poet/author Arnold Adoff and divided her time between New York City and Ohio.In 1969, Hamilton published The Time-Ago Tales of Jahdu, four tales about a trickster boy-hero who expressed his sense of freedom by ``running along'' and whose favorite exclamation was ``Woogily!'' Like those in Time-Ago Lost (1973), they were set in a framing story about ``Mama Luka'' in ``a fine, good place called Harlem,'' telling her stories to young Lee Edward. Now Hamilton drops the framing story, adds a central section (``Jahdu Adventure'') with four new pieces (including one involving the giant Trouble as a robot and one in which Jahdu encounters several folkloric characters), and tightens and reshapes the whole. By eliminating the explicit celebration of pride in the black experience, she highlights the rich blend of creation myths, philosophies, and folklore that inspired these tales; they seem more universal here than they did in the earlier setting. But they are still not easy; like the later books in the Justice series, they can be hard to follow, their events imposed by symbols that seem arbitrarily intertwined. Still, the language is vigorous and masterfully honed, while the character of lively, powerful, self-defining Jahdu has appeal even though some of his adventures are less than compelling. Moser contributes the attractive design and 20 beautifully painted glimpses of the scenes and characters in Jahdu's world. (Fiction. 8-12) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

T. Joshi&#39;s landmark history of supernatural fiction, the initial focus is on an incredible efflorescence of weird writing at the turn of the twentieth century-a period that many scholars have referred to as the Golden Age of weird fiction. Such figures as Arthur Machen, Lord Dunsany, Algernon Blackwood, M. R. James, and H. P. Lovecraft elevated weird fiction to a level of high artistry never seen before, and their work continues to inspire writers up to the present day. Other authors such as Walter de la Mare, L. P. Hartley, and William Hope Hodgson also contributed important novels and tales. Lovecraft&#39;s influence extended to such of his contemporaries and successors as Clark Ashton Smith, Robert E. Howard, August Derleth, Robert Bloch, and Fritz Leiber. In the years following Lovecraft&#39;s death, a new crop of writers-led by Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, Shirley Jackson, and Charles Beaumont-brought horror down to earth and into the realm of ordinary life. Their work laid the groundwork for the extraordinary emergence of weird fiction as a best-selling phenomenon in the work of Ira Levin, Stephen King, Peter Straub, Clive Barker, Anne Rice, and many others. At the same time, more literate figures such as Ramsey Campbell, T. E. D. Klein, and Thomas Ligotti continued to expand the boundaries of the weird in work of the highest literary polish. Today, such writers as Caitl�n R. Kiernan, Dennis Etchison, and many others continue to probe new directions in weird fiction.</p><p></p><h2>Quick Study Laminated Reference Guide - Pre Algebra</h2><p>PRE-ALGEBRA QUIZZER Quick Study Guide This 3-panel &#34;Quizzers&#34; edition of BarCharts&#39; Pre-Algebra guide is guaranteed to bring about the higher grades you&#39;ve been seeking!

Agnew's divisive rhetoric skyrocketed his popularity, but he grew weary of exclusion from the Nixon inner circle. Nixon, concluding that Agnew was not the man to succeed him, conspired to dump him in 1972 and later to remove him from the line of presidential succession. But before Nixon's presidency collapsed in Watergate, a tawdry scandal of payoffs to Agnew in the White House accomplished the job.<p>Jules Witcover, a leading political reporter of that period, wrote political biographies of both men and coauthored the acclaimed account of the Agnew resignation, <i>A Heartbeat Away</i>. Now, with three decades of perspective, a trove of new material including Nixon's White House tapes and interviews with close Nixon-Agnew associates, Witcover has written a captivating narrative that reveals how the foibles, pettiness and weaknesses of each man destroyed that marriage, and ultimately their careers. <i>Very Strange Bedfellows'</i> revealing look into the flawed and fascinating Nixon presidency will be catnip to anyone interested in American politics and American history.</p></p><p><b>Jules Witcover</b> is the author of many books, including <i>The Year the Dream Died: Revisiting 1968 in America</i> and <i>The Resurrection of Richard Nixon</i>.

In fact, a whole new generation of ab exercises and machines have advanced abdominal workouts to new levels of sophistication, designed for maximum efficiency to provide the trim, toned midsection that everyone wants. But how do you put the exercises together into a routine for your specific physique and needs? <b>The Complete Book of Abs</b> shows you how. <br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ab book for everyone--from beginners to fitness professionals<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;More than one hundred ab exercises--from traditional crunches and sit-ups to such cutting-edge techniques as corkscrews and hanging knee raises--drawn from diverse sources, including gymnastics, yoga, and the martial arts<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes the "Fifteen Minutes a Day to Ultimate Abs" system, which will take you from an undeveloped stomach to a rippled washboard look in six months<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;Dozens of favorite and new routines from America's foremost coaches, trainers, and bodybuilders<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;How to be your own personal trainer and put together your own routines<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;The most up-to-date information on diet and nutrition, including a personal <br>template to maximize diet-exercise efficiency<br><br>Already a fitness classic, <b>The Complete Book of Abs</b>, is the definitive guide for abdominal toning and strengthening. No one who's serious about working out should be without it.</p><p>Kurt Brungardt was at the front end of the abdominal obsession. His <i>Abs of Steel</i> video was a bestseller, and the original <i>Complete Book of Abs</i>, published in 1993, was considered the bible of midsection exercises for trainers and fitness enthusiasts. The obsession has only grown since then, manifested by dubious infomercial products, a burgeoning fitness-magazine industry promising readers great abs with almost no investment of time and effort, and (perhaps because of the shortcomings of the first two phenomena) a boom in the demand for legitimate nutritionists and personal trainers. Even Brungardt himself came out with a 1998 book, <i>3-Minute Abs</i>, to take advantage of the craze.<p> With all that going on, it seems hard to believe that there's anything new to say about abdominal exercise. Indeed, this revised version of <i>The Complete Book of Abs</i> doesn't really try. There is a new prebeginner midsection routine, which leads into the more advanced exercise regimens described in the original book, and a handful of new exercises. But other than that, the expanded sections are in nutrition (several new pages of recipes) and total-body fitness (new photos demonstrating exercises for body parts other than abs).</p><p> Still, the original package is a terrific deal: more than 100 exercises, numerous training routines, and lots of basic information about exercise and diet. Each abdominal exercise is rated for difficulty on a scale of 1 to 3 and how risky it is to the lower back. The routines are complete and thoughtfully compiled, and there's not a bit of advice in the entire book that isn't scientifically legitimate. That's why this book--in either edition--remains indispensable for those serious enough about fitness to need information that goes beyond the basics. <i>--Lou Schuler</i> END</p><b>Kurt Brungardt</b> has been a personal trainer in New York for seven years.

As the nation&#39;s first commercially successful professional novelist, Cooper was instrumental in helping to shape America&#39;s early cultural identity and giving voice to his country&#39;s unique political and social concerns. The five novels collected in this volume - The Pioneers, The Last of the Mohicans, The Prairie, The Pathfinder, and The Deerslayer - comprise Cooper&#39;s Leather-Stocking Tales, and feature the adventures of woodsman Natty Bumppo, a figure of independence and self-reliance who is recognized today as an American folk icon.

Reinterpreting the Gospel was particularly compelling for Matthew&#39;s church because his Christians lived in a time of profound transition. The Passion of Jesus, then, was not simply a story of suffering out of the past but a point of identification for the Christians of Matthew&#39;s own time. For us twentieth century Christians, who also know the peculiar suffering and hope of living in an age that is both dying and being born, the Passion of Jesus according to Matthew has special meaning.The passion is the climactic event in each of the gospels. These volumes elucidate the passion in its historical background and explore its theological breadth and depth.</p><h2>As Ever Booky</h2><p>Book by Hunter, Bernice Thurman</p><p></p><h2>Mansfield Park (Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p>In one of Jane Austen's most morally complex and richly drawn novels, she paints a fascinating portrait of an upper-class family and the cousin who comes to live with them. Fanny Price, the timid and poor relative of the wealthy Bertrams, finds comfort only in her gentle cousin, Edmund, with whom she gradually falls in love. But the departure of the father on business, and the arrival of the worldly Henry Crawford and his sister Mary, irrevocably change the family&#x2019;s fortunes. A penetrating account both of individual motives and social mores, Mansfield Park remains as fresh today as when it was written. The world's greatest works of literature are now available in these beautiful keepsake volumes. Bound in real cloth, and featuring gilt edges and ribbon markers, these beautifully produced books are a wonderful way to build a handsome library of classic literature. These are the essential novels that belong in every home. They'll transport readers to imaginary worlds and provide excitement, entertainment, and enlightenment for years to come. All of these novels feature attractive illustrations and have an unequalled period feel that will grace the library, the bedside table or bureau.</p><p>Though Jane Austen was writing at a time when Gothic potboilers such as Ann Ward Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> were all the rage, she never got carried away by romance in her own novels. In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Mansfield Park, the idyllic Bertram family estate, becomes home to a poor young relative, Fanny. In this wealthy world of social accomplishments and flirtations, the sensible Fanny finds herself out of place, yet secretly in love with her cousin, Edmund. Jane Austen employs her unerring wit to brilliantly capture the social and moral values of an English society at a time of great upheaval</p><h2>A Beatles Miscellany: Everything you always wanted to know about the Beatles but were afraid to ask</h2><p>This fact-filled volume includes UK and US discographies with full track listings and chart positions, a complete list of live performances from 1960 to 1969; a look at the origins of the group&#x2019;s name; quotes about them from such names as Mick Jagger, Steven Spielberg, Tony Blair, and Francis Rossi; other musicians who temporarily or nearly joined them, from early stand-in drummers to heavyweights such as Eric Clapton and Billy Preston; their producers, management and &#x2018;inner circle&#x2019;; their connections with Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, Donovan, Badfinger and others; their British radio and TV appearances; the &#x2018;Paul is dead&#x2019; story that gripped some of the media in the late 60s; the album titles and films that nearly were but ultimately weren&#x2019;t; and much more.

If you love movies, if you love to laugh, if you'll believe anything, then this book is for you, if you ask me." -- Paul Rudnick</p><p>"Irreverent, Hilarious." -- Publishers Weekly</p><p>"Screamingly Funny." -- The Advocate</p>New York film critic Gelman-Waxner here collects her irreverent, hilarious "If You Ask Me" columns that have appeared during the past five years in Premiere magazine. Of yet another Tom Cruise coming-of-age drama (Far and Away), she writes, "It's like watching Tom in a $60 million school play, where you never forget that he's really the star quarterback and the class president." William Hurt (in The Accidental Tourist) speaks "very slowly, like a Mormon on quaaludes." Gelman-Waxner is kinder to Daniel Day-Lewis, Dennis Quaid and Michelle Pfeiffer, whose "cheekbones and thighs could be grounds for a class action suit by women everywhere." The persona of the columnist-homemaker, mother and wife, married to a "wildly sought-after Upper East Side orthodontist"-is carefully fashioned as the author intersperses self-aware mockery of yuppie excesses with astringent comments about Hollywood. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Quiet Gentleman</h2><p><b>An unwelcome return . . .</b> <p>Unscathed from the wars, Gervase Frant finally returns to his father's estate to claim his title as the new Earl of Stanyon.

Soon it becomes increasingly clear that someone wants the new Earl of Stanyon <i>dead</i> . . .</p></p><p>The late Georgette Heyer was a very private woman. Her novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or personal life. She was born in Wimbledon in August 1902. She wrote her first novel, The Black Moth, at the age of seventeen to amuse her convalescent brother; it was published in 1921 and became an instant success.<br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Her work included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a barrister, and they had one son, Richard.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>In the guide-books it figured as Stanyon Castle; on the tongues of the villagers, it was the Castle; the Polite World spoke of it as Stanyon, as it spoke of Woburn, and of Cheveley. It was situated in Lincolnshire, not very many miles from Grantham, rather nearer to Stamford: a locality considered by those who were more interested in the chase than in any particular grandeur of scenery to be admirable. It had more claim to be called a Castle than many another nobleman's seat. A medi�val fortress, of which various not very interesting records were to be found in the muniment room, now used by Mr Theodore Frant as an office, had previously stood upon the site; and such portions of the ancient building as had survived the passage of time had been incorporated into the Tudor manor which had succeeded the fortress. Later generations had enlarged and beautified the structure much as their fancies dictated, any difficulty of adding to the mansion being overcome by the designing of another court. The Frant who survived friendship with Bluff King Hal scandalized his generation by the lavish use of oak for wainscoting; his grandson, having enjoyed the advantages of travel, built a new wing, and embellished the old with gildings and painted ceilings; a later Frant, succumbing to the prevailing fashion, ran riot in the rococo style, created the Fountain Court, and was prevented only by death from attempting something of a still more grandiose conception; his heir, one of Mr Walpole's more fervid adherents, reverted to the Gothick, and by the time an unlucky fall at a regular stitcher, when out with the Old Club, put a period to his career, nowhere in England could have been found such massive doors of oak, such ponderous iron latches, so many pointed, narrow windows, as at Stanyon.</p> <p>The sixth Earl of St Erth, possibly thinking that his principal seat already sprawled over too much ground, more probably prevented from adding a wing in the Palladian style by the straitened times in which he had the ill-fortune to live, contented himself with rebuilding the stables, papering a great many of the rooms, and installing a closed-stove in the enormous kitchen. This was declared by an embittered valet to be the only sign of modern civilization in the entire pile; but the head-cook, mistrusting modernity, allowed it to be used merely for the boiling of vegetables by one of his underlings, while he himself continued to preside over his furnace, with its antiquated ovens, its huge spits, and its iron cauldrons. Unaccustomed guests, wandering distractedly down ill-lit galleries, discovering stairs that led only to uncharted domestic regions, and arriving, flustered and exhausted, where they had been for long attended, had been known to express astonishment that anyone should choose to live in such a rabbit-warren when he owned two other and more convenient country residences. Neither of these, it was true, could boast of Great Halls, Minstrels' Galleries, Armouries, Towers, or Moats: on the other hand, no draughts whistled down their passages; no creeping chill arose from damp walls; and their chimneys very rarely smoked.</p> <p>Neither the sixth Earl nor his second wife perceived anything amiss with Stanyon: the Earl because it was the home of his childhood, his lady because she had been bred in an even more inconvenient mansion in the bleak north, and would, in any event, have unhesitatingly bartered comfort for pomp, had she been offered a choice in the matter. The Earl's first wife had hated Stanyon. But the Earl's first wife, though admittedly a lady of birth and quite remarkable beauty, had proved herself to have been quite unworthy of the high position she was called upon to fill. Before her son was out of leading-strings, she ran away with a notorious rake. Her lord, cuckolded, betrayed, and turned into a laughing-stock, expunged her name from the family records, permitted no mention of her to be made within his walls, and scarcely thought himself avenged when he learned that she had died, three years after her flight, in conditions of distress and hardship. His steward and his housekeeper, both persons of sentiment, hoped that upon his death-bed he would remember her, and speak of her with a forgiving tongue, for it seemed to them incredible that so gentle and lovely a lady should hold no place in his heart or memory. They even indulged their fancies by supposing that his overt dislike of his elder son was caused by the secret pangs the sight of the fair boy, who was indeed the image of his mother, caused him to feel. But if the Reverend Felix Clowne, my lord's Chaplain, was to be believed, the Earl's last coherent speech, forcibly phrased if feebly uttered, was a complaint that the wine he had commanded his valet to bring to his room was corked. He had earlier bestowed his blessing upon Martin, his younger son; he had had a kind word for Theodore, his nephew; he had taken punctilious leave of his lady; he had sent proper messages to his married daughter; but the names of his first wife and of his heir had not passed his lips. Nor had his heir arrived at Stanyon to attend his death-bed, although it was certain that Mr Theodore Frant had sent a letter express to him in Flanders, warning him that his father's demise was imminent. Captain Viscount Desborough, as he then was styled, was at Mons, with his regiment, and it was conceivable that a high sense of his military duties had prevented him from applying for furlough at a moment when Napoleon was almost hourly expected to cross the frontier. But the seventh Earl, surviving a minor, but rather bloody, engagement at the village of Genappe, and a major engagement at Waterloo, still showed no disposition to return to the home of his ancestors. He sold out, but he remained on the Continent, reposing the fullest confidence in his cousin's ability to administer his estates. Not until twelve calendar months had passed since his father's death did his cousin, and the Dowager Countess, receive tidings from him that he was in England, and about to take possession of his inheritance. He wrote a very civil letter to his mother-in-law, informing her of the proposed date of his arrival at Stanyon, and enquiring in the politest way after her health, and the healths of his half-brother and sister. It was a very pretty letter, the Dowager allowed, but, she added, in unhopeful accents, his mother had had just such caressing ways, and had shown herself to be a Snake in the Bosom.</p> <p>&#x2018;I should perhaps warn you, ma'am, that my cousin will not relish animadversions upon the character of his mother,' said Mr Theodore Frant, a little tight-lipped. &#x2018;In his presence, such remarks should be spared.'</p> <p>&#x2018;My dear Theo,' responded the Dowager, &#x2018;it would be odd indeed if I were to be obliged to consult you on the observances of civility!' He bowed, and, because she cherished no ill-will towards him, she said graciously: &#x2018;Or anyone else, I am sure! In this house, Desborough or, as I must learn to call him, St Erth may be sure of every attention called for by his consequence.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Just so, ma'am,' Mr Frant said, bowing again.</p> <p>&#x2018;Providence has decreed that he should succeed to his dear father's honours,' pronounced the Dowager, thinking poorly of Providence. &#x2018;One might have supposed that military service in the Peninsula a very unhealthy locality, I understand, setting aside the chances of Violent Death in an engagement, which cannot be altogether precluded might have rendered the present occasion unnecessary. But it was not to be! Had my advice been sought, I should have considered myself bound to state that a military career, for one whom I should have had no hesitation in declaring to be far from robust, could be little short of Fatal! That, my dear Theo, I must have said, for, whatever must be my maternal feelings, if there be one thing upon which I pride myself it is my observance of my duty as a Christian! Happily, as it then seemed (though, according to the workings of an inscrutable fate, it now appears to be a circumstance of little moment), my advice was not sought. Since Lady Penistone chose to interest herself so particularly in her grandson, and my dear husband saw nothing objectionable in the connection, it was not for me to raise my voice. On her head, I said at the time, be the outcome! No doubt her ladyship is a good enough sort of a woman in her way: I do her the justice to acknowledge that she did not, as one might have feared she would, from the incurable levity of her behaviour, condone her unhappy daughter's misconduct: but if she petted and indulged Desborough from any other motive than a malicious desire to tease my poor husband I shall own myself astonished! A spiritless boy, I always thought him, with too much reserve to be pleasing. His career at Eton, you know, was quite undistinguished: a very odd sort of a soldier he must have been!'</p> <p>&#x2018;It is some years since you have seen my cousin, ma'am,' Mr Frant interposed, in a measured tone.</p> <p>&#x2018;I hope,' said the Dowager, &#x2018;I am not to be blamed for that! If Lady Penistone chose to invite the boy to stay with her during his school vacations, and my lord to acquiesce in the arrangement, I take heaven to witness that it was by no expressed wish of mine that Desborough ceased to regard Stanyon as his natural home! On every head my conscience is easy: while he was a child I did my duty towards him; and I am determined now that as no word of censure for his conduct in absenting himself from a beloved parent's obsequies shall be permitted to pass my lips, so also no mark of the respect due to the Head of the Family shall be unobserved. I shall receive him in the Hall.'</p> <p>This momentous decision being faithfully adhered to, a chilly afternoon in spring saw five persons assembled in what had once been the Great Hall of the Castle. The artistic energies of several generations had largely obliterated most of its original features, but the hammer-beams in its lofty roof remained, and a vast fireplace, made to accommodate the better part of several tree-trunks. The carved screens, having been discovered to have become worm-eaten, had been removed in a previous age, the apartment being thrown open to the vestibule, or entrance-hall, situated at right-angles to it. From this smaller apartment the Grand Staircase, erected in the latter half of the seventeenth century on a scale designed to allow some dozen persons to walk up it abreast, rose in one imposing flight to a broad half-landing, whence it branched to right and left, thus attaining the main gallery of the Castle. Several massive doors strengthened by applied iron-straps, besides the great front-door opposite to the staircase, opened on to the vestibule, a circumstance which added nothing to the comfort of the Hall, in itself a passage to a series of saloons beyond it. The heat thrown out by the logs burning in the fireplace was considerable, but was unavailing to prevent the draughts sweeping through the room. These seemed to come from all quarters, even the heavy curtains which had been drawn across the windows composing almost the entire long wall opposite the fireplace being continually stirred by them. It was dusk, and candles had been lit in the sconces as well as in the several candelabra which stood on the various tables. The little tongues of flame flickered continually, causing the wax to melt unevenly, and making it impossible for one of the persons assembled in the Hall to set the stitches in her embroidery with any degree of accuracy. Having twice changed her seat to no purpose, she folded the work, and replaced it in a tapestry-bag, drawing forth, in its stead, a prosaic piece of knitting, with which she proceeded to occupy herself, in the manner of one prepared to make the best, without comment, of adverse conditions.</p> <p>The furnishing of the Hall might have been taken as an example of the heterogeneous nature of the whole Castle, few of the pieces which it contained having been chosen with any nicety of judgment. A fine refectory table, pushed under the windows, and several carved oak chairs with wooden seats, were the only objects which bore any particular relation to their surroundings, the rest of the furniture consisting of pieces representative of every age and style, and including a modern and very ugly side-table, with a marble top, supported by brazen gryphons' heads. Two suits of armour of the surcoatless period guarded the entrance, and several shields, pikes, halberds, and gisarmes were arranged upon the wall above the high plaster mantelpiece. These were flanked by a full-length portrait of the late Earl, leaning negligently with one leg crossed over the other, against the shoulder of his horse; and a fine Battle-piece, of which the most noticeable features were the arresting figure of the commanding officer in the foreground, and the smoke issuing in woolly balls from the mouths of innumerable cannons.</p> <p>Only one of the five persons gathered round the fireplace in expectation of the Earl's arrival seemed to be conscious of the discomfort of her situation, and she made no complaint, merely shifting her chair so that the leaping flames should not scorch her face, and pinning her shawl securely across her shoulders to protect them from the cold blast from the vestibule. The Dowager Countess, regally enthroned in a wing-chair, with her feet upon a stool, was indifferent to draughts; neither her son, Martin, moodily standing before the fire, and kicking at a smouldering log, nor Mr Theodore Frant, engaged in snuffing a candle in the branch set in the centre of the refectory table, was aware of any unusual chilliness; and the Chaplain, seated at her ladyship's left hand, had long since become inured to the Spartan conditions prevailing at Stanyon, and had pronounced the gathering to be very snugly placed. This tribute earned him a gracious smile from the Dowager, who said that it had frequently been remarked that few fires gave out so fierce a heat as this one. She then desired Miss Morville, in a voice of mingled civility and condescension, to be so good as to run up to the Crimson Saloon, and to fetch from it a little hand-screen. Miss Morville at once laid aside her knitting, and departed on her errand; and, as though her absence released him from constraint, Martin looked up from his scowling scrutiny of the fire, and exclaimed: &#x2018;This is a curst business! I wish it were well over! Why must we kick our heels here, waiting on his pleasure? The lord knows we don't want him! I have a very good mind to ride over to eat my mutton with Barny!'</p> <p>His cousin looked frowningly at him for a moment, but said nothing. Another candle needed attention, and he dealt with it methodically. He was a powerfully built man, nearing his thirtieth birthday, with a resolute, rather square countenance, and a good deal of reserve in his manner. The cast of his features bore a certain resemblance to that of his young cousin's, but the likeness existed merely in the aquiline trend of the nose, the slightly heavy line of the jaw, and the set of the eyes under brows which overhung them enough to give a forbidding look to the face. The colour of his eyes was a clear, light gray, as cool and as inexpressive as lake-water; his mouth, with its firmly closed lips, betrayed no secrets, but seemed to show that its owner, besides possessing resolution of character, knew how to keep his own counsel. His address was good, and his manner had all the quiet assurance of his breeding.</p> <p>With Martin, it was otherwise. Every change of mood was reflected in his eyes, so dark a brown as to appear almost black, and in the sensitive curves of his full mouth. Six years younger than his cousin, he had not altogether thrown off the boy; and, from having been the idol of his mother and the pet of his father, he was a go...</p></p><h2>Daredevil Psychology: The Devil You Know (Volume 9) (Popular Culture Psychology)</h2><p><b>An in-depth analysis of the psychology behind the popular character Daredevil</b>.<br><br> In the early 1960s, Stan Lee and company revitalized the comic book market by imbuing new characters and their stories with human, emotional depth lacking in other superheroes.

It is an area of great contrasts -- geographically beautiful, yet the underlying crust of the region is cracked along great tectonic fault lines. These natural fault lines pale in comparison to the borders made by man, which have added further layers of complexity to a region where war is frequent, horrors are unspeakable, and history is unfathomable. It is not an area of the world that many would care to visit -- unless they had been there before.</p><p>Simon Winchester, a seasoned reporter, visited the region twenty years ago. During the recent Kosovo crisis, he remembered that first trip and the people he met, and he decided that parallel journeys might well be a device for explaining with sympathy the true nature of this fractured region. Two great capitals, Vienna and Istanbul, whose ceaseless imperial rivalries in the past played so profound a role in shaping the savage divisions of the region today, would anchor his second journey to the region.</p><p>With the war under way, he enlisted the aid of a linguist friend and set off from Vienna on a long, scimitar-shaped adventure through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo, Bulgaria, and Turkey, arriving at the Golden Horn just as the war was officially declared over. With luck, and through valuable personal contacts, Winchester managed to be in Macedonia on the day the NATO forces moved in to assume control of Kosovo -- and because the commanding general was an old friend, he rode in with the liberating columns of troops and armor. </p><p> This is not a book about the war, but rather an intimate portrait of the region painted while the war was going on. It is also an attempt to understand what has led this region to violence -- now, in the past, and inevitably again in the future. Written with a keen sense of time and place, <em>The Fracture Zone</em> is at once current and timeless. It goes behind the headlines and gives us a true picture of a region that has always been on the brink. Simon Winchester's remarkable journey puts all the elements together -- the faults, the fractures, and the chaos -- and makes sense out of a seemingly senseless place.</p></p><p>Simon Winchester, a British newspaper reporter for 30 years and the author of 13 books (including <i>The Professor and the Madman</i>), has turned his attention to the Balkans, an area he visited years ago on a road trip from Vienna to Istanbul--a journey he retraced in the spring of 1999. <i>The Fracture Zone</i> describes both of those trips, concentrating on the history and character of the region more than the recent war and its aftermath. Winchester has spent most of his career as a foreign correspondent, but his more recent occupations as historian and a writer for <i>Cond� Nast Traveler</i> are in evidence here. Winchester's angle on the Balkans is unique and well written: those who have been bewildered at best and bored at worst by the Balkan conflict may find that <i>The Fracture Zone</i> captures their interest better than hundreds of news accounts of war atrocities. "Why is there, and seemingly always has been, this dire inevitability about the Balkans being so fractious and unsettled a corner of the world?" Winchester wonders aloud. That eternal question continues to plague world statesmen and, though not fully answered here, affords the opportunity for an interesting exploration.<p>Simon Winchester is the acclaimed author of many books, including <em>The Professor and the Madman</em>, <em>The Men Who United the States, The Map That Changed the World, The Man Who Loved China, A Crack in the Edge of the World,</em> and <em>Krakatoa</em>, all of which were <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers and appeared on numerous best and notable lists. In 2006, Winchester was made an officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Her Majesty the Queen.

He has returned from the far North where he tells of strange sights-a beautiful city hovering in the sky above the pole, a shimmering Dust that settles on and delineates all but human children. Lyra is scarcely able to save his life before Lord Asriel is off again, on a quest to answer the riddle of the world. Meanwhile, children are disappearing, and when Lyra&#39;s dearest friend is taken by the Gobblers, she determines to save him - a decision which leads her on a great journey, a journey that will lead to the discovery of her mother, a disastrous betrayal and the beginning of the unravelling of the mystery of Dust.</p><p>Some books improve with age--the age of the reader, that is. Such is certainly the case with Philip Pullman's heroic, at times heart-wrenching novel, <i>The Golden Compass</i>, a story ostensibly for children but one perhaps even better appreciated by adults. The protagonist of this complex fantasy is young Lyra Belacqua, a precocious orphan growing up within the precincts of Oxford University. But it quickly becomes clear that Lyra's Oxford is not precisely like our own--nor is her world. For one thing, people there each have a personal <i>d�mon</i>, the manifestation of their soul in animal form. For another, hers is a universe in which science, theology, and magic are closely allied: <blockquote> As for what experimental theology was, Lyra had no more idea than the urchins. She had formed the notion that it was concerned with magic, with the movements of the stars and planets, with tiny particles of matter, but that was guesswork, really. Probably the stars had d�mons just as humans did, and experimental theology involved talking to them. </blockquote> Not that Lyra spends much time worrying about it; what she likes best is "clambering over the College roofs with Roger the kitchen boy who was her particular friend, to spit plum stones on the heads of passing Scholars or to hoot like owls outside a window where a tutorial was going on, or racing through the narrow streets, or stealing apples from the market, or waging war." But Lyra's carefree existence changes forever when she and her d�mon, Pantalaimon, first prevent an assassination attempt against her uncle, the powerful Lord Asriel, and then overhear a secret discussion about a mysterious entity known as Dust. Soon she and Pan are swept up in a dangerous game involving disappearing children, a beautiful woman with a golden monkey d�mon, a trip to the far north, and a set of allies ranging from "gyptians" to witches to an armor-clad polar bear. <p> In <i>The Golden Compass</i>, Philip Pullman has written a masterpiece that transcends genre. It is a children's book that will appeal to adults, a fantasy novel that will charm even the most hardened realist. Best of all, the author doesn't speak down to his audience, nor does he pull his punches; there is genuine terror in this book, and heartbreak, betrayal, and loss. There is also love, loyalty, and an abiding morality that infuses the story but never overwhelms it. This is one of those rare novels that one wishes would never end. Fortunately, its sequel, <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, will help put off that inevitability for a while longer. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman<br>I love this book, so when we decided to give out copies at a convention this summer, I was thrilled!

Ask someone to identify these names and they might respond: prison, city in France, Egyptian queen, secluded glen, paradise, mountain, mail fee, fortification. And they would be right. But for golfers, the correct answer is that each belongs on a list of the game&#x2019;s best&#x2013;known par&#x2013;three holes. All owe their fame to a natural setting and the imaginative genius of gifted course designers who believed that less can really be more.<p></p><p>At last count the United States Golf Association library contains 25,000 books, including 1,200 under the heading &#x201c;Golf Courses.&#x201d; Search as one may, there is no volume devoted solely to the par&#x2013;three hole. This was a curious omission that we decided to rectify. Our goal: Canvass the world for some of the finest, most interesting, dramatic, beautiful, historic, delightful and confounding one&#x2013;shot holes and assemble them in a collection that showcases their particular virtues and role in golf history.</p><p>Why else a book on par&#x2013;three holes? Looked at imaginatively, a par three is &#x201c;the whole&#x2013;in&#x2013;one.&#x201d; Most par threes let a golfer see the entire challenge &#x2014; tee to green &#x2014; and, with skill and luck, complete the hole in a single shot &#x2014; the ace.</p><p>In a distance&#x2013;obsessed era, the threes remind us that controlled shotmaking is fundamental to the game, and, on many short holes, finesse is all. Augusta National Golf Club #12, Cypress Point Club #15 and Royal Troon Golf Club #8 exemplify this dimension.</p><p>Maybe too it&#x2019;s about respect. Golf&#x2019;s short holes are sometimes overshadowed by the tougher handicap holes that comprise the finishing stretches on a course. But look deeper, and gradually the list of threes that regularly produce high scores grows. They aren&#x2019;t pushovers, for sure. And golf history highlights many a par&#x2013;three seventeenth &#x2014; the Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, Pebble Beach Golf Links and Pinehurst Country Club No. 2 Course, for example &#x2014; that has determined victory or defeat in major competitions.</p><p>In his &#x201c;Thirteen Principles&#x201d; of golf course design, Dr. Alister MacKenzie, creator of Augusta National and Cypress Point, stated firmly that there should be &#x201c;at least four one&#x2013;shot holes&#x201d; on every course. In his case, he also laid out two in a row (the fifteenth and sixteenth at Cypress Point), or made the eighteenth a three (Pasatiempo Golf Club). As we shall document, course architects know the importance of well&#x2013;made, strategically placed one&#x2013;shotters and use them to enhance the quality of a course.</p><p>We very much subscribe to the thought of Japanese architect Shunsuke Kato who said, &#x201c;The importance of the par&#x2013;three hole is that it truly represents the designer&#x2019;s policy as to the character of the golf course. It is a wrong idea that a par&#x2013;three hole is easy to make because it is just a short yardage. The [good] designer puts his heart into making a par&#x2013;three hole special among others.&#x201d; The top courses are distinguished by a strong complement of par threes, each good to great. In many cases, one of the threes becomes the signature hole.</p><p>To set the stage for our collection, a Prologue presents the origin of three famous one&#x2013;shot holes. This is followed by a brief essay, titled &#x201c;Evolution,&#x201d; which highlights the thoughts of leading designers about the par three and provides some historical context on its development.</p><p>Course ratings and rankings seldom produce complete agreement. Our choices are based on many years of playing, walking and photographing courses worldwide. Buttressing our own judgment are the critical observations and writings of golf course historians and architects, leading golf writers from many eras and local experts who shared their takes on individual holes.</p><p>For those who need to discriminate, we offer two tiers &#x2014; &#x201c;Gold&#x201d; and &#x201c;Silver,&#x201d; and, for fun, we&#x2019;ve created an &#x201c;Ultimate 18&#x2013;Hole Par&#x2013;Three Course.&#x201d; Further, we think the arrangement of the top holes around a dominant geographical feature or distinguishing design element is a more interesting way to look at them. In the end, our selection of 100 from the 130,000 or so par threes in the world can only be illustrative of their overall excellence.</p><p>We hope you&#x2019;ll get to play some, or if you have already, to relive your experiences through our words and pictures.</p><i>&#x2014; Tony Roberts and Michael Bartlett</i></p><h2>Vietnam Airborne (Elite Series 29)</h2><p>The Airborne units that fought against the Viet Cong in Vietnam were a select brotherhood.

Declan, an Irishman in his 20s, is a wandering minstrel, trying to see a bit of the world before he settles into whatever fate has in store for him. He is intelligent, eager to please, but lacks maturity.<p> The plot revolves around the murder of a young man whose body is found dumped in an old car outside an Indian restaurant in the town of Haworth in Northern England. This is Bront� country, where throngs of tourists pay homage to the writing family. Sent from Leeds to investigate are detective constable Charlie Peace and his boss, detective superintendent Mike Oddie. Charlie's black skin marks him as an oddity in the small villages, but it also helps him dig up the kind of details which other cops might not be offered by the locals. Declan falls under an umbrella of suspicion, due in part to his relationship with his eccentric employer and the strange circle of acolytes who surround him. Peace and Oddie put together the pieces with skill. But this one isn't really a whodunit: you can probably figure that out in 50 pages. It's the motive and the circumstances of the crime that make the book a gem. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Robert Barnard (1936-2013) was awarded the Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement and the Nero Wolfe Award, as well as the Agatha and Macavity awards.

Never previously available in a single trade volume, the majority of Redon�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s noirs �&#x20ac;&#x201c; over 250 illustrations �&#x20ac;&#x201c; are finally collated here, along with illuminating excerpts from the decadent texts which inspired their creation.

And along with Gustave Moreau and Georges Seurat, Redon was one of the first painters to excite the imagination of a young André Breton.<br><br>A contemporary of the Impressionists, Redon chose to align himself with literary Symbolism, demonstrated by his friendship with Stéphane Mallarmé and his visual interpretations of the �&#x20ac;&#x153;decadent�&#x20ac; texts of such writers as Baudelaire, Flaubert, Poe, and others. His reputation as a purveyor of phantasmic visions was sealed by the description of his work included in J-K Huysmans�&#x20ac;&#x2122; decadent bible A Rebours, in 1884, and his rise to prominence in the 20th century was precipitated by the inclusion of many of his works at the controversial Armory Show, held in New York in 1913.</p><p>Odilon Redon (born Bertrand-Jean Redon; French: April 20, 1840 - July 6, 1916) was a French symbolist painter, printmaker, draughtsman and pastellist. He is often cited as a key influence on the Surrealists.CONFESSIONS OF AN ARTIST<br><br>ODILON REDON<br><br>I have made an art according to myself. I have done it with eyes open to the marvels of the visible world and, whatever anyone might say, always careful to obey the laws of nature and life.<br><br> I have done it also with love for several masters who led me to the worship of beauty.<br><br> Art is the supreme range, high, salutary and sacred; it blossoms. In the dilettante it produces only delight, but in the artist with anguish, it provides grains for new seeds.<br><br> I think I surrendered obediently to the secret laws which led me to form, as best I could, and, following my dream, the things into which I put my entire being. If this art went against the art of others (something I do not believe), it also brought me, however, an audience that time maintains, and even brought me friendships of quality and kindness that are sweet to me and that reward me.<br><br> Notes that I express here will help in understanding this art more than whatever I could say about my ideas and technique. Art participates also in the events of life. This will be my only excuse for speaking exclusively about myself.<br><br> My father often used to say to me: "Look at those clouds, can you see as I can, the changing shapes in them?" And then he would show me strange beings, fantastic and marvelous visions, in the changing sky. He loved nature and sometimes told me, about the pleasure he had felt in the American savannas, in the vast forests he had cleared, where he was once lost for many days; he told about the courageous and rather wild life he had led there when he was young, venturesome of fortune and freedom.<br><br> From the stories he used to tell us within the family about his former adventures (he had been a colonist, he had owned negroes), he appeared to me an imperious being, independent, even hard, before whom I always trembled. Although today, at a long and confused distance, and with all that remains of him in my eyes, I see in the depths of his own, which easily moistened with tears, a merciful and sweet sensitivity that his outer harshness could scarcely conceal.<br><br> He was tall, straight and proud, with great natural distinction. Born near the small city of Libourne, (where several villages and many families bear our name), he was young when he left for New Orleans during the First Empire wars, oldest son of a wealthy family, impoverished by the hardness of the times. .....</p><h2>The Traitors Wife (Thorndike Press large print Christian historical Ffction)</h2><p>Retells through the perspective of her maid the story of Peggy Shippen Arnold, the mastermind behind America&#39;s most infamous act of treason, as Peggy hatches a plot to deliver West Point to the British.</p><p>Allison Pataki is the &#34;New York Times&#34; bestselling author of &#34;The Traitor s Wife &#34;and &#34;The Accidental Empress&#34;.

She checked the address scrolled on the worn piece of parchment again. Her grandmother&#x2019;s familiar handwriting directed Clara to arrive at the Shippen mansion on the corner of Fourth and Walnut Streets, deep in the district that housed the city&#x2019;s wealthiest residents.<br> <br>A crack of a coachman&#x2019;s whip drew Clara&#x2019;s attention away from the Shippens&#x2019; door, and she gazed over her shoulder toward the street&#x2014;a noisy thoroughfare of horse hooves, carriage wheels, and the deafening drum of marching British soldiers. A servant leaned out of a window several houses down and emptied a series of chamber pots onto the cobblestone street before disappearing once more into the home. The closeness of the noise and stink was unlike anything Clara had ever experienced on the farm.<br> <br>The Shippen mansion, like its adjacent structures, was composed of red brick and built with an orderly symmetry: the sort of architectural purposefulness she&#x2019;d heard about since George Washington and Thomas Jefferson had built their homes in this style. The tight row of brick society homes lining Fourth Street resembled one another but for the shutter shades; some houses had green shutters, some light blue, some dark blue, some white. The Shippens had elected to paint their shutters black.<br> <br>The Shippen mansion sat back from the street, flanked in front by a small patch of grass and two cherry trees in the full bloom of late spring. The entryway, a wide wooden door, stood above three short steps and below a triangular pediment. A top row of arched dormer windows poked out from the sloping roof, with two rows of shuttered panes below. The windows&#x2014;built not only for allowing in light, but also for their decorative appeal&#x2014;testified to their owner&#x2019;s wealth; a passerby on the street might be so lucky as to catch a glimpse of the famous Judge Edward Shippen studying his books, or spy one of his beautiful daughters as she flitted through the vast parlor on her way to receive a gentleman caller.<br> <br>This must be the right home. Clara knocked at the imposing front entrance again. The door opened, and Clara was greeted by the lined face of a woman past her youth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good afternoon.&#x201d; The woman had soft features framed by a graying bun, which peeked out around the edges of a clean, white-linen mobcap. She greeted Clara with an appraising smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it Clara Bell, come at last?&#x201d; The aged woman opened the door wider to reveal a fine appearance&#x2014;an indigo petticoat made of linen to accommodate the warmer weather, draped by a clean linen apron. On top she wore faded gray stays over a crisply pressed white blouse. A fichu was tied around her neck to ensure the modesty required for service in such a fine home. She rolled back her cuffed sleeves and waved Clara inside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Clara entered through the open door, clutching her tarpaulin sack as she stepped over the threshold. The woman closed the front door behind her, shutting out the noise and stink of the street and allowing Clara to ease into the airy interior of the home. Its soundless tranquility was a welcome relief after the hustle of Fourth Street.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Clara Bell, we&#x2019;ve been awaiting your arrival all day.&#x201d; The older woman smiled, taking Clara&#x2019;s sack from her arms. &#x201c;Was it a tiring journey from the country?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was fine, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Clara answered, even as she was certain her haggard features betrayed her fatigue.<br> <br>&#x201c;You took a post carriage?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That must have cost you a small fortune.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m grateful to have the employment, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; Clara managed a timid smile, finding words evasive in the grand hallway in which she&#x2019;d suddenly found herself. She felt as though she&#x2019;d awoken into this buffed and varnished grandeur without a clear recollection of the circumstances that had brought her to Philadelphia. Clara blinked, remembering. The abandoned farmhouse. Oma dying. In her last moments, her old grandmother penning a letter to a friend from years ago. Oma urging Clara to leave the Hartley farm, as the Hartleys themselves had done, fleeing the approach of the British and the Iroquois.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am Mrs. Quigley, housekeeper for the Shippens.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very nice to meet you, Mrs. Quigley.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; The housekeeper&#x2019;s reply faded to a sigh as she surveyed Clara&#x2019;s appearance. Clara stood still, feeling her cheeks grow warm; her warm-weather petticoat of linen was creased and dusty from the trip, but it was the only one she possessed of its kind. She&#x2019;d only rotate it out of her wardrobe when the weather changed and the crisp autumn air required her wool petticoat. Unlike this housekeeper, Clara&#x2019;s clothes were not bought in a store, but were homespun, sewed by Oma. Clara wore her petticoat and stays in the cotton ticking pattern, off-white fabric with blue stripes. Her apron, once white, had been laundered so many times that it now bore a yellowish tint.<br> <br>&#x201c;Follow me, Clara.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley turned and crossed the room in several brisk strides. Clara followed, hurrying to take in the surroundings as she kept apace. The Shippens&#x2019; front hall was well lit by a wall of broad, clean windows. The focal point at the center of the hall was the expansive staircase, which drew the eyes up in a languid arc until it reached the second floor. Removed from the entrance was a maple fireplace. A fire crackled even on this warm spring afternoon, filling the front hall with its welcoming aroma, which mingled with the distinct scents of furniture polish and ladies&#x2019; perfume.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quite a bit grander here than it was at the farmhouse, I imagine.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley turned just in time to catch Clara, eyes rapt, examining a feather-light shawl of creamy robin&#x2019;s egg blue. It was store-bought and fine, its border embroidered with yellow silken flowers, its colors as bright as a springtime morning. It had been left, haphazardly discarded over the back of an upholstered armchair, as if its owner could be reckless with an item so fine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Miss Peggy&#x2019;s shawl. We better put it back in her closet where it belongs or we&#x2019;ll never hear the end of it.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley scooped up the expensive item. &#x201c;All right, then, follow me, child.&#x201d; Clara trailed the housekeeper through an open doorway into an ample drawing room. The Shippens&#x2019; furniture seemed designed to impress the eyes with ornate decoration as much as to entice the body into its plush comfort. The chairs of the drawing room were carved out of smooth mahogany, their slender curves varnished to a glossy sheen. Clara&#x2019;s legs suddenly felt leaden with fatigue; how she longed to sink for just one moment into one of these chairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;ve never been inside a drawing room before, girl,&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley remarked, fluffing a silk pillow on a nearby settee.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not one like this, ma&#x2019;am, I haven&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Clara&#x2019;s eyes roved hungrily over every detail of the quiet room, the only sound issuing from an encased clock, taller than Clara herself, that occupied a far corner. Oil paintings in bronze frames adorned the walls. A soft splash of May sunlight streamed in through the windows, mingling with the dancing shadows cast by the fresh white candles in their sconces. How fine they must be, the people who frequent these spaces, Clara thought. At night, when the sunlight vanished and only candlelight remained, how easy it must be for them to slip into a corner and whisper a piece of gossip or listen to a verse of an admirer&#x2019;s poetry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Enough of your daydreaming. What do you think, girl?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s lovely here,&#x201d; Clara stammered, looking around with ill-disguised awe.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice, isn&#x2019;t it? Course, you&#x2019;ll hear every day how the money&#x2019;s gone and the furniture is growing outdated, but I think it&#x2019;s just fine.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley smiled, the skin around her serious eyes creasing into a soft, worn pattern. &#x201c;Well, Clara, you&#x2019;ve had a long trip from the countryside; let&#x2019;s have you come in and catch your breath.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley led Clara through the drawing room past a smaller, smartly decorated parlor with salmon-colored walls, shelves of books, and a silk sofa across from a card table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Books for the judge, cards for the ladies. That&#x2019;s how they&#x2019;ll spend their evenings. Course, Miss Peggy won&#x2019;t be contented with either activity&#x2014;she wants to be out dancing every night.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley kept a brisk pace as she crossed the room. Once through the parlor, a doorway allowed entry into a separate wing, which could be closed off from the front of the house. The two women proceeded now down this long, narrow passageway. No light shone here except for that which pierced the small windows of the rooms on either side of the corridor, and there was no ornamentation on the clean white walls. Clara stole quick glances into the rooms as she followed the housekeeper. Some rooms appeared occupied, others abandoned. This wing, she realized, housed the Shippen family&#x2019;s servants.<br> <br>Clara peeked into the empty rooms she passed&#x2014;most held just bedframes and unused chamber pots, but they looked comfortable and of a good size. &#x201c;Mrs. Quigley, if you please, why are all of these rooms empty?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. Quigley sighed, jingling a set of brass keys as she led Clara farther down the hall. The old woman appeared unsure how to answer the question. &#x201c;Just a few years back we were at full capacity, with two servants in each of these rooms. But we&#x2019;ve had to let so many folks go, most of the rooms are empty now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;On account of the war?&#x201d; Clara asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a curious one, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley glanced back over her shoulder at Clara, studying her for a moment before answering in a hushed tone. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have heard that Judge Shippen has refused to take a side&#x2014;either Tory or Rebel.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clara nodded. The Shippens were one of the city&#x2019;s most prominent families. The news had traveled as far as Hartley Farm when Doctor William Shippen, the judge&#x2019;s brother, had come out strongly for the colonials. That&#x2019;s when his brother, Clara&#x2019;s new employer, had cut all business dealings to avoid appearing partial to either army.<br> <br>Mrs. Quigley continued in a muted tone. &#x201c;Without much coming in, we run a lean operation now that the war is on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clara wondered why it was that they were bringing her into the household under these circumstances. Mrs. Quigley must have guessed at her thoughts.<br> <br>&#x201c;But Mistress Peggy fought hard to fill your post; she insisted to her father that we had need for a lady&#x2019;s maid in the household. What with me, well, I&#x2019;m busy enough running the home that I barely have time to tend to the missus, let alone her two daughters.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are they like?&#x201d; Clara asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Shippen ladies?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; Clara nodded.<br> <br>Mrs Quigley considered the question. &#x201c;You shall see for yourself, soon enough.&#x201d; The old woman halted at the end of the corridor. &#x201c;Here we are, Clara. After you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clara hesitated, standing still.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your bedroom, child,&#x201d; the housekeeper said. &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clara passed the housekeeper, her eyes lowered. Her bedroom? It would be the first room she&#x2019;d ever had to herself. At the farm, she&#x2019;d always slept on a straw pallet beside the kitchen fire, Oma&#x2019;s snoring frame curled up beside her. But here she had a bedframe. And a door that could shut, offering an entirely new privilege: privacy.<br> <br>Of course, when compared to the front of the Shippen house&#x2014;with tables serving no purpose other than to host card games, and silver bowls serving no purpose other than to hold flowers&#x2014;these quarters were dull. But Clara could barely contain a giggle over the thought of having her own room.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing fancy, I&#x2019;m afraid. Will it suit you?&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley fidgeted with her brass keys, apparently in a rush to get to her next chore.<br> <br>&#x201c;Suit me? Why, a room to myself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Clara looked around her new domain. There was a single straw mattress on a rusted iron frame. A simple dresser of dark walnut stood against the opposite wall, and a thin desk and stool occupied the corner. The window, small but bright, faced out the back of the house. Clara crossed the room and peeked out the window. She spied the formal garden, done in the Continental style with tightly clipped shrubs, pruned rose bushes, and a tidy carpet of green lawn. Beyond that was a small orchard, its trees appearing to hold the first signs of apples. Cherry blossoms bloomed in the May warmth, forming neat columns of shady pathways. The manicured grass, so unlike the wild fields of the farm, was intersected by meandering pebbled walkways, where her ladies must tread when receiving finely dressed visitors. Birdsong pierced the blue sky, as did the aroma of fresh-petaled flowers. It was an Eden in the midst of the colonies&#x2019; busiest city.<br> <br>Behind the garden stood a rectangular stable, where Clara spied a young man sitting between the large doors. Clara watched this figure as he plucked out a simple melody on a handmade guitar, as if entertaining himself while awaiting the arrival of some riders. Suddenly aware that he was being surveyed, the stableboy paused his singing, looking up in time to catch Clara&#x2019;s gaze. She ducked her head back behind the window, blushing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, so you&#x2019;ve seen Caleb.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley was beside her at the window, swinging it open to allow in the fresh spring air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who is he, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The resident troublemaker.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley smirked, wiping the dust from the windowsill.<br> <br>Clara glanced back outside and noticed that the young man named Caleb was no longer sitting at his post. She inhaled, taking in the heady scent of fresh flowers. &#x201c;Mrs. Quigley, have you grown accustomed to all of this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, it&#x2019;s a beautiful old home, all right, but don&#x2019;t let it seduce you. There&#x2019;s plenty to be seen in this house that ain&#x2019;t so beautiful.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley&#x2019;s eyebrows arced a moment before her face softened. &#x201c;Clara, I hope you don&#x2019;t mind my saying so, especially after I&#x2019;ve only just met you, but you look just like your grandmother did. Course, when she was a lot younger.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clara lowered her eyes, her focus blurring at the mention of her Oma.<br> <br>Mrs. Quigley continued. &#x201c;She was a dear friend of mine, and I was happy to have the opportunity to help her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ll miss her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d; Clara&#x2019;s eyes stung with the threat of tears, but she did not wish to weep before her new employer. Still, it seemed strange, illogical, to refer to her grandmother as someone from her past.<br> <br>&#x201c;When she wrote, asking me to find a post for you in the Shippen household, I was eager to help. Anything to make her final rest a bit easier.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley sighed, and Clara bit her lip, hesitant to respond in case her voice cracked.<br> <br>&#x201c;But enough of that business. Where were we? You think you shall be comfortable here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very.&#x201d; Clara straightened her posture, grateful to change topics.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Mrs. Quigley slapped the mattress once, producing a cloud of dust. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get one fresh candle a week, and not more, so mind you how you use your nighttime lighting. Quills and ink you&#x2019;ll have to request on a need-by-need basis.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clara thought about this: she had no one to write.<br> <br>&#x201c;Judge Shippen tries to be generous, but there&#x2019;s only so much he can manage, especially with trying to keep Betsy and Peggy in the latest fashions.&#x201d; Clara could tell from the housekeeper&#x2019;s terse manner that this was a topic she&#x2019;d discussed before.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, Clara, I suppose you&#x2019;ll want to change before you meet Mistresses...</p><h2>Transcendentalism as a social movement, 1830-1850</h2><p>Hardcover with dust jacket.

From Strauss to Schniewind, Perrin to Drewermann, rabbit trails to roadways, Beasley-Murray charts the complex and sometimes confusing paths of interpretation. Obviously, any interpreter wishing to begin at ground-zero must take seriously the forces that have shaped the modern understanding of Jesus' words concerning the End.<p>This study culminates nearly 40 years of research, for Beasley-Murray's passion for Mark 13 began in 1954 with the release of <i>Jesus and the Future;</i> the present volume is a completely revised and expanded edition of the former work, whose longevity as a centerpiece in discussions on Mark 13 warranted its revision and expansion.</p><p>"George Beasley-Murray's <i>Jesus and the Future </i>(1954) and <i>A Commentary on Mark 13</i> (1957) are among the very few biblical studies from the 1950s that have stood the test of time. The former is still a model of how the history of biblical research should be written. . . . Now after almost forty years (!) he has integrated the two works into one and updated his history of the interpretation of Mark 13 into the 1990s. For those of us who have a sense of how much has happened in biblical studies since 1954, this is a tremendous achievement. No substantial passage of the New Testament has ever been better served in a single volume. The work's new title, <i>Jesus and the Last Days,</i> signals the fact that it is in most respects a new work, one that will for many years be an indispensable tool for anyone working either on the Gospel of Mark, the eschatology of Jesus, or the eschatology of the New Testament.

And yet it is written with elegance and style. . . . <i>Jesus and the Last Days</i> will be essential reading for New Testament scholars and other groups.

He lives in Colorado.Because of its multiple subplots and points of view, many performers might find this story daunting. Not Dick Hill. He's able to switch from psychologist Alan Gregory's point of view to Gregory's ex-wife, Meredith, in a flash. He plays Gregory as understated and somewhat wimpy and Meredith as catty and narcissistic. When their stories come together, we learn that Gregory's ex-wife has asked him to help search for a pregnancy surrogate who has disappeared. Gregory investigates this disappearance and its connection to a woman who vanished in the Grand Canyon years earlier. There's even more to this plot-a terrorist bombing and a missing child. Happily, Gregory's marriage and Hill's reading survive.

Those words of advance praise from another celebrated author scarcely convey just how powerfully mesmerizing is the latest book by <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio talk show host Larry Elder. </p><p><i>Dear Father, Dear Son</i> is a personal memoir of Elder's troubled&#x2014;one might even say tortured&#x2014;relationship with his father, and the astonishing outcome that develops when Elder, at long last, confronts him. </p><p>Says Elder: A man's relationship with his father&#x2014;every boy, every man lucky enough to have a father in his life has to figure that out. My own father? I thought I knew him&#x2014;even though he seldom talked about himself. And what I knew I hated&#x2014;really, really hated. Cold, ill-tempered, thin-skinned, my father always seemed on the brink of erupting. Scared to death of him, I kept telling myself to find the courage to "stand up to him". When I was 15, I did. After that, said Elder, we did not speak to each other for 10 years. </p><p>And then we did&#x2014;for eight hours. The result can't be described. It has to be experienced. </p><p>As reflected in the book's subtitle&#x2014;<i>Two Lives...Eight Hours</i>&#x2014;one extraordinary, all-day conversation between Elder and his long-estranged father utterly transformed their relationship. It is no exaggeration to say the book will likewise transform listeners. </p><p>Indeed, calling it stunning, Burt Boyar, co-author of the bestselling autobiography on Sammy Davis, Jr., says of <i>Dear Father, Dear Son</i>: "Above all it is a wonderful read. I am tempted to call it a page-turner but in my case I hated to turn every page because that meant I was getting closer to the end and I did not want it to end.... The book is filled with emotion. It is, of course, a handbook for life. I guess it is that above all things. Any kid who reads it and follows the advice of how to live his life just has to come out well." </p><p><i>Dear Father, Dear Son</i> is the story of one man discovering a son he never really knew. And of the son finding a man, a friend, a father who had really been there all along.</p></p><p>A firebrand libertarian according to Daily Variety, best-selling author, radio and TV talk-show host Larry Elder has a take-no-prisoners style, using such old-fashioned things as evidence and logic. Larry shines the bright light of reasoned analysis on many of the myths and hypocrisies apparent in our system of government, our society, and the media itself.

This unique guidebook to the architecture of the City of Light is illustrated with more than 200 maps and 650 drawings by the author, who has searched out even the most remote or difficult-to-find sites where small masterpiece can be seen. Organized by arrondissement (neighborhood), the book offers handy building-by-building listings, with a line drawing and an accompanying text for each notable structure. Easy-to-follow maps suggest routes for walking tours. Useful indexes of both monuments and architects are also included. Paris: Buildings and Monuments is an exceptional tribute to the splendid architectural richness of Paris and an indispensable companion for visitors to the city.</p><p>Few cities can approach the quality and number of Paris's distinguished buildings and streetscapes. But if you go there to find those treasures, you'll miss most of them if you lack a good guidebook. Michel Poisson is a Parisian architect who spent the last several years sketching the city's buildings and urban spaces, locating them on maps of his own devising, and providing the requisite data and commentary.<p> His book is organized by <i>arrondissements</i>, the city's traditionally defined districts, and each entry includes a short building description or comment, a freehand drawing, an address, date, and the names of the closest metro station, the architect, and the patron. The last is a nice touch usually lacking in architectural guides. Nor is that the only unusual element of this book, which is as singular as a Citro�n <i>deux chevaux</i>. It is larger and heavier than a normal guidebook--6.5 inches by 9.5 inches, 464 pages, and about 3 pounds--which may limit its portability on the field. The hand-drawn maps are a bit funky, and the illustrations vary from rich and full of character when showing older buildings to simplistic and inexpressive in the case of some newer projects.</p><p> Still, it's an amazing effort for one person: 200 maps, 535 entries, 650 drawings, and all the research and prose that goes with them. Poisson is a savvy urban explorer, and he steers readers not only to obvious sights such as the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Centre Pompidou, and Notre-Dame but also to scores of old and new places that you might never find on your own. And while it's easy to get disoriented in this complex city, you won't lose your place in the book--it thoughtfully features a bound-in red ribbon bookmark. <i>--John Pastier</i></p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Founding Fathers&#39; Guide to the Constitution</h2><p>EXCELLENT HARDBACK BOOK.

Worthy of remembrance no less than Wake Island, Leyte Gulf, and Tarawa are the great unsung battlefields of Buna, Shaggy Ridge, and the Driniumor River on New Guinea, as well as the torpedo-infested waters off New Georgia; and the deadly skies over Rabaul and Wewak. <br><p>Authoritative, yet written in a highly readable narrative style, <i>South Pacific Cauldron</i> is the first complete history embracing all land, sea and air operations in this critically important sector of that oceanic war. Unlike most other World War II accounts, this work covers the South Pacific operations in detail, including the little-known final Australian campaigns that continued until the Japanese surrender.<br></p><p>Author Alan Rems breathes life into the major figures of the South Pacific campaigns, including brilliant and imperious General Douglas MacArthur, audacious and profane Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, and bibulous and indelicate Australian General Thomas Blamey. No less interesting are others that will be mostly new to readers, including many from the Japanese side, like the indomitable generals Noboru Sasaki and Hatazo Adachi. As for the fighting men, many of their stories are captured in accounts of the actions for which some were awarded the Medal of Honor, Victoria Cross, and other decorations for valor.<br></p><p><i>South Pacific Cauldron</i>'s story is enhanced with 16 maps and 40 photographs, many rarely seen, that were carefully chosen from official American and Australian sources. The book includes a detailed chronology to put the widely separated operations in context and a detailed bibliography for additional reading on the subject.</p></p><p>Alan Rems, a retired CPA, has been a regular contributor to <i>Naval History</i> magazine since his first writing effort that earned the U.S. Naval Institute's 2008 Author of the Year award. He lives with his wife, a retired newspaper managing editor, in Centreville, Virginia.From the Preface<br>Nearly forty years ago, Guadalcanal veteran and author James Jones lamented how little was remembered about the World War II battlefields of the South Pacific. He wrote, "Almost all of them names people in the United States never heard of." The same could likely have been said about how much was remembered by Australians and New Zealanders, whose nations fought there alongside America. Since Jones' lament, the situation can only have worsened with the deaths of most who served there.<br>Even the setting is largely forgotten. The words "South Pacific," for most, evoke only the fictional island paradise on which Rodgers and Hammerstein set their musical adaptation of James Michener's tales. But there were few "enchanted evenings" in the very different South Pacific region--Melanesia-- that we speak of here. Encompassing the Solomon Islands, the eastern half of New Guinea, and the waters and lands of the Solomon and Bismarck seas in between, this region contained some of the worst terrain and weather of all World War II combat zones. With towering mountains; treacherous razorback ridges; dense, disease-ridden jungles; great miasmal swamps; infernal heat and humidity; and torrential rainfall, the environment there was challenging enough without the dangers of battle.<br>From that war zone, one battlefield, Guadalcanal, has remained etched in American memory as a symbol of courage and endurance. Australians and New Zealanders might remember, too, the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Kokoda Trail, fought when their nations were under dire threat of invasion from Japan.<br>After these 1942 battles, the Allies went on the offensive and the character of the war in the South Pacific changed. Beachheads were obtained on large islands at relatively low cost, and terrain, weather, and supply difficulties often slowed advances more than the Japanese did. It was slow, hardscrabble fighting, hardly material for dazzling war reporting, and what public attention remained was mostly absorbed by the more spectacular Central Pacific offensive that started in November 1943 with Tarawa. Except for those at home with ties to men whose lives were invested there, the war in the South Pacific was eminently forgettable. But for those who were there it was The War. And its result influenced the outcome of World War II no less than El Alamein, Kursk, Anzio, Normandy, and Iwo Jima did.<br>James Jones commented about the war in the South Pacific in 1943: "They had a year of battles, fought without any great victories to stimulate troop morale. . . . Short, sharp, costly fights, each of them, which got scant publicity at home." His observation about publicity was correct, but Jones' mordant view about what was accomplished was not.

Character studies and philosophical reflections offer the reader a veiled glimpse of Eliot&#39;s perception of her own character, as well as those of her friends.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.Impressions of Theophrastus Such, published in 1879, marks the end of George Eliot&#39;s career and the end of her life with George Henry Lewes. In many ways this fable is a final testimony to her brilliance, and yet it is puzzling that it has traditionally been judged as inferior to her other works. It remains, on the contrary, a significant reflection of her earlier works and an experiment apart from them. As Nancy Henry points out in her comprehensive introduction, this book goes beyond even Daniel Deronda in positing the role of collective memory in the future of national cultures and the power of literary texts in creating and preserving both. It is a complex and deeply intelligent synthesis of Eliot&#39;s previous great works as well as an interesting departure from them. It signals the culmination of her development as a writer of organic form and the beginning of what could be termed an early modernist experimentation through fragmentation of form. In eight dexterous chapters, Theophrastus reflects on the habits of his contemporaries - on their tendency to romanticize past ages, the ruthless nature of scholarly debate, the mocking of traditionally revered works of the absurdity of decadence in art, and the justification for Jewish and other modern nationalisms. As the character of Theophrastus emerges and coheres, the mature and accomplished George Eliot asks what has become of nineteenth-century English culture while speculating on how it might adapt and survive.</p><h2>Image and Pilgrimage in Christian Culture: Anthropological Perspectives (Lectures on the History of Religions, New Ser., No. 11)</h2><p>Book emphasizes cultural aspects of pilgrimage and focuses on the theological doctrines and popular notions which promote Christian pilgrimage, and the symbols and images which embody them. (from DJ blurb)</p><p>Image and Pilgrimage examines in detail two anthropological important aspects of the practice of pilgrimage. One is the context-the theological background into which each pilgrimage is &#39;born&#39; and the folk traditions through which the people recognize the implications of the initiating event. The other is the repertoire of symbols and images that embody that experience and continue to clothe the original vision in varying ways.&#34;This book constitutes an important foreshadowing of issues that have become prominent in more recent anthropology.&#34; -- &#34;Culture&#34;</p><h2>Proving Darwin: Making Biology Mathematical</h2><p><p>Groundbreaking mathematician Gregory Chaitin gives us the first book to posit that we can prove how Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution works on a mathematical level.<br>&nbsp;<br>For years it has been received wisdom among most scientists that, just as Darwin claimed, all of the Earth&#x2019;s life-forms evolved by blind chance. But does Darwin&#x2019;s theory function on a purely mathematical level? Has there been enough time for evolution to produce the remarkable biological diversity we see around us? It&#x2019;s a question no one has yet answered&#x2014;in fact, no one has even attempted to answer it until now.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this illuminating and provocative book, Gregory Chaitin argues that we can&#x2019;t be sure evolution makes sense without a mathematical theory. He elucidates the mathematical scheme he&#x2019;s developed that can explain life itself, and examines the works of mathematical pioneers John von Neumann and Alan Turing through the lens of biology. Chaitin presents an accessible introduction to metabiology, a new way of thinking about biological science that highlights the mathematical structures underpinning the biological world. Fascinating and thought-provoking, <i>Proving Darwin</i> makes clear how biology may have found its greatest ally in mathematics.</p></p><p><p><b>Gregory Chaitin</b> is widely known for his work on metamathematics and for his discovery of the celebrated Omega number, which proved the fundamental unknowability of math. He is the author of many books on mathematics, including <i>Meta Math! The Quest for Omega</i>. This is his first book on biology. Chaitin was for many years at the IBM Watson Research Center in New York. The research described in this book was carried out at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, where Chaitin is now a professor. An Argentine-American, he is an honorary professor at the University of Buenos Aires and has an honorary doctorate from the National University of Cordoba, the oldest university in Argentina.</p><p><b><i>One</i></b><br><b>Introduction: Overview of Proving Darwin</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Like many pure mathematicians, I like giving &#x201c;chalk&#x201d; talks: improvised talks given on a blackboard or white- board using a minimum of technological assistance. Another strategy is for me to fill the board with what I want to cover just before I start to lecture, while people are still coming in, so that they can take in all the key ideas at a glance. In a large auditorium, however, a projector is necessary, or nobody will see anything.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the facing page you can see me giving an overview of this book in a large auditorium at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. The four slides I prepared are on pages 5 and 6. They summarize Chapters 2 to 4, which outline my strategy for making biology mathematical. After you finish reading these chapters, you should review the slides. Then they will make more sense.<br>&nbsp;<br>You&#x2019;ve heard people refer to DNA as a computer program? Well, that&#x2019;s the whole idea: to make this metaphor into a mathematical theory of evolution. In fact, it turns out that the mathematical tools for doing this were already available in the 1970s. More precisely, we will treat evolution as a random walk in software space. Random walks are an idea that mathematicians feel comfortable with, although the space we are walking around in at random is bigger than usual.<br>&nbsp;<br>I call this proposed new field &#x201c;metabiology&#x201d; because it is a highly simplified version of real biology&#x2014;otherwise I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to prove any theorems. These theorems are presented in Chapter 5, which is the climax of the book, and was a talk that I gave at the Santa Fe Institute. Chapters 6 to 8 discuss the broader significance of metabiology, theological, political and epistemological. And then there are two appendices.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the first appendix you can read the crucial section on self-reproducing automata in John von Neumann&#x2019;s far-seeing &#x201c;DNA = Software&#x201d; paper that influenced Sydney Brenner, who in turn influenced Francis Crick&#x2014;a remarkable fact that I only discovered while working on this book. And the second appendix gives some additional mathematical details that may be of interest to experts.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, I give a short list of suggested further reading, some books and a few articles that are important if you want to really understand metabiology. These are the books and articles that helped me the most to come up with a strategy for making biology mathematical, plus a few more related items that I threw in just for the fun of it. Enjoy them all!</p></p><h2>Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (Forgotten Books)</h2><p>Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution is a book by Peter Kropotkin on the subject of mutual aid, written while he was living in exile in England. It was first published by William Heinemann in London in October 1902. The individual chapters had originally been published in 1890-96 as a series of essays in the British monthly literary magazine, Nineteenth Century.<br><br>Written partly in response to Social Darwinism and in particular to Thomas H. Huxley's Nineteenth Century essay, "The Struggle for Existence," Kropotkin's book drew on his experiences in scientific expeditions in Siberia to illustrate the phenomenon of cooperation. After examining the evidence of cooperation in nonhuman animals, "savages," "barbarians," in medieval cities, and in modern times, he concludes that cooperation and mutual aid are as important in the evolution of the species as competition and mutual strife, if not more so. <i>(Quote from wikipedia.org)</i><br><br><b>About the Author</b><br><br>Peter Kropotkin (1842 - 1921)<br>Prince Peter (Pyotr) Alexeyevich Kropotkin (9 December 1842 - 8 February 1921) was one of Russia's foremost anarchists and one of the first advocates of anarchist communism: the model of society he advocated for most of his life was that of a communalist society free from central government. Because of his title of prince and his prominence as an anarchist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, he was known by some as "the Anarchist Prince". Some contemporaries saw him as leading a near perfect life, including Oscar Wilde, who described him as "a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ which seems coming out of Russia."He left behind many books, pamphlets and articles, the most prominent being his works The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops, and his principal scientific offerin</p><p>Prince Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin was a Russian zoologist, evolutionary theorist, philosopher, scientist, revolutionary, philologist, economist, activist, geographer, writer, and prominent anarchist.

Original.</p><p>Best known as the author of <i>To Catch a Thief</i>, which became the classic Alfred Hitchcock film starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, <b>David Dodge</b> also wrote numerous other best-selling thrillers, adventure novels, and non-fiction accounts of his world travels, including <i>The Long Escape, How Lost Was My Weekend</i>, and the highly collectible <i>It Ain't Hay</i>.It has been 54 years since Dodge's most famous book, <i>To Catch a Thief</i>, hit the shelves and was shortly thereafter made into the classic Hitchcock film. In reading his latest, written just before his death in 1974 and never before published, it's easy to see why his writing translated so well to Hollywood noir, with its tight-lipped narration, a tough easy rider in the lead and vivid descriptions of both glittering locales and gamine ladies. Our hero, con man Curly, is working the C�te d'Azur&#x2014;as well as a matronly woman of means&#x2014;when he meets the Hon. Regina Forbes-Jones, aka "Nemesis," who pegs him for a small-time grifter straight off. The on again/off again flirtation between the callused American swindler and the saucy British beauty is the delicious meat of the book. Unfortunately, Dodge chooses to spend most of the narrative chronicling Curly's scams across the world: from Cannes to Tangier, Marrakech, Lima and Bel�m. When the relationship between Reggie and Curly takes center stage, though, the book shines, and it ends with a gratifying twist. Dodge fans should pick this up for good old times, but newcomers may want to start with his time-tested classics. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Delivered to crowded congregations in the city of London, the content is popular and in the best seventeenth century tradition of experimental preaching which spoke to heart and conscience as well as the mind. It would be too much to say that Greenhill provides everything necessary for an understanding of this prophet but what he does give surely justified two nineteenth century editions. It is the best of these editions which is here reprinted.</p><p>William Greenhill (1591-1671), author of the Exposition of Ezekiel published by the Trust in the Geneva series of commentaries, was born in Oxfordshire and educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he matriculated at the age of just thirteen years in 1604. He was elected a demy of Magdalen College the following year, graduated with a B.A. in 1608, and an M.A. in 1612.<br><br>From 1615 to 1633 Greenhill held the Magdalen College living of New Shoreham, Sussex. In 1643 he was a member of the Westminster Assembly, and about the same time became minister of the parish of Stepney, Middlesex, where, at one time, he lectured with his fellow Puritan, Jeremiah Burroughs. As Burroughs preached at seven in the morning and Greenhill at three in the afternoon they were known respectively as 'the Morning Star' and 'the Evening Star' of Stepney.<br><br>After the death of Charles I, Greenhill was appointed by the parliament as chaplain to three of the king s children: James, Duke of York (afterwards James II), Henry, Duke of Gloucester, and the Lady Henrietta Maria.<br><br>Greenhill was ejected from his parish immediately upon the Restoration in 1660, but he continued to serve a congregational church in Stepney until his death in 1671. John Howe referred to him as 'that eminent servant of God, Mr Greenhill, whose praise is still in the churches'.'We always get something out of Greenhill whenever we refer to him. He had not, of course, the critical skill of the present day, but his spiritual insight was keen. He rather commented on a passage than expounded it.' --<i>Charles H.

Contributors like David Simon, creator of HBO&#x2019;s The Wire, and renowned political cartoonist Kevin Kallaugher (better known as KAL), tell what it was like to work in what may have been the last golden age of American newspapers -- when journalism still seemed like &#x201c;the life of kings&#x201d; that H.L. Mencken so cheerfully remembered. The writers in this volume recall the standards that made the Sun and other fine independent newspapers a bulwark of civic life for so long. Their contributions affirm that the core principles they followed are no less imperative for the new forms of journalism: a strong sense of the public interest in whose name they were acting, a reverence for accuracy, and an obligation to keep faith with the reader.</p><p>Stephens Broening was Associated Press correspondent in Paris, Moscow, and Lisbon from 1965 to 1976 before joining the Sun as assistant city editor in 1976. In 1978 he was named the paper's first Op-Ed page editor, a post he held until 1985 when he was assigned to the Sun's Washington bureau as diplomatic correspondent. In 1990, Broening joined the International Herald-Tribune in Paris as a news editor, responsible for the IHT&#x2019;s coverage of the Americas and Asia. He returned to Baltimore in 1996 and for ten years was a visiting scholar in history at the Johns Hopkins University.<br><br>Frederic B. Hill was a reporter and foreign correspondent for the Sun, including tours as bureau chief in London and Paris, covering Europe and southern Africa, before becoming an editorial writer for the Evening Sun. He was foreign affairs director for Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr. (R., MD) in 1985 and 1986. He then established the State Department&#x2019;s Office of Special Programs. The office conducted policy planning exercises (war games) and roundtable discussions on security, political, economic, and global issues for State and key national security agencies from 1986 to 2006. He is the author of Ships, Swindlers and Scalded Hogs, the rise and fall of a mid-nineteenth- century Maine shipyard.Broening and Hill, two seasoned newspapermen from the Baltimore Sun, enlist their former colleagues&#x2014;veteran reporters and editors&#x2014;to document the splendid history of the newspaper. The book explores the Sun from the inside out, covering the company&#x2019;s organizational makeup, journalistic standards and modes of operation, political affiliations and reputation in Washington, D.C., and readership, as well as development of specific features such as the op-ed page and political cartoons. There are personal remembrances and career highlights aplenty. The title refers to a remark by illustrious Sun alum H.L. Mencken, 'an important voice in the country&#x2019;s intellectual conversation' who equated reporting to a privileged way of life. Certainly, the description of overseas assignments by foreign correspondent and Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;finalist Gilbert A. Lewthwaite supports this point of view; he recalls staff receiving 'a royal welcome on their travels... though personal perks did nothing to detract from the serious professional intent.' As with any fraternity, there are favorites and the feared, among them the 'fabled' managing editor Charles H. Dorsey, Jr., a 'lifelong deskman who had &#x2018;never been outdoors,&#x2019; ' writes reporter Ernest B. Furgurson, who served as the paper&#x2019;s Washington bureau chief from 1975 to 1987. This is an informative exploration of a bygone era in print journalism, and the romantic reminiscences of the hardworking journalists who toiled to fill the Sun&#x2019;s pages will resonate with baby boomers and media study students.

(<i>The American Spectator</i>)<br><br>There is a lot of that colorful atmosphere in this pleasant collection of memories by 27 former editors and reporters of the Baltimore Sun. But even if one has never read the newspaper or spent much time in the town that calls itself 'Charm City,' this is a book worth reading. It is a cautionary tale of the decline of the American daily newspaper and its once salutary if sometimes abrasive impact on our democracy. (<i>The Washington Times</i>)<br><br>For a vivid example of what real journalism looks like [read] The Life of Kings, a just-published series of essays by Baltimore Sun reporters, [which] describes what their paper was like before (as has happened at too many other papers) digital advertising gutted newsroom budgets and investment companies bought out more civic-minded owners to fire-sale the wreckage.

From war to politics, from corruption to the Chesapeake Bay, these essays capture the rawness and the melody of life as recorded by some of the best reporters of our time. Together, they convey the character of one paper, The Baltimore Sun. But they do more than that: they capture the golden era of print journalism and remind us why it's still an essential part of the fabric of this great country. " (Judy Woodruff, The PBS NewsHour)<br><br>&#x201c;The Life of Kings is a truly enlightening read, offering us a glimpse of journalism through the eyes of its frontline participants. It&#x2019;s a stellar collection from the reporters and editors who shaped the Baltimore Sun. The essays range from comedy to tragedy, showing us the humanity behind the words that appear on our newsprint &#x2013; and we are afforded the opportunity to explore that humanity from the inside out, stepping behind the curtain at the Sun to see the inner workings of a generation of journalism&#x2019;s kings (and queens).&#x201d; (Barry Levinson, Oscar Award-winning writer and film director of Diner, Tin Men, Avalon, and Liberty Heights)<br><br>&#x201c;Those who mourn the passing of old-fashioned newspaper journalism will find it at once stirring and deeply melancholy to read The Life of Kings. This really is the way it was, not just at the once-indispensable Sunpapers but in the city rooms and bureaus of papers across the country that played equally essential roles in the lives of the communities they served. Think of this book as a message in a bottle, one that journalists of the future will read with wonder.

Decorated with Louisiana irises and Southern pines, the crafts created by the ladies of Newcomb College during the early 20th century represent some of New Orleans' most iconic and distinctive art. Exhibited in more than 150 photographs, these pieces demonstrate the craftsmanship that established the Newcomb movement as one of critical artistic importance.</p></p><p><p>The crafts of the Newcomb Style, an art form as native to Louisiana as its jazz, are celebrated here in a comprehensive and definitive history invaluable to Art Nouveau connoisseurs and collectors. This first full-color edition preserves the late Suzanne Ormond's collection of and knowledge about the genre of American crafts predominantly produced by the women of Newcomb College at the turn of the twentieth century.</p><p>In the wake of the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial of 1884-85, when decorative arts and pottery began to flourish in New Orleans, Josephine LeMonnier Newcomb established the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College for Women as part of Tulane University. The college opened its doors in 1887, and as early as 1895, its craftswomen were producing pottery, needlework, metal and leather crafts, jewelry, bookbinding, block printing, and calligraphy, exhibiting the character that evolved into the internationally renowned Newcomb Style.</p><p>This extensive second edition features never-before-seen photographs and includes pieces from the Louisiana State Museum, the Newcomb Art Gallery, the Foundation for the Crafts of the Newcomb Style Collection, and the personal collections of S. Lisa Ormond Caire and John W. Ormond II, Suzanne Ormond's children, with their captions. An introduction by Ormond's children and a foreword by the late New York Times art critic John Canaday are included, as are biographies of the directors and artisans along with notes about their ciphers that enable collectors to identify and authenticate Newcomb crafts. An expansive history details each period of the Newcomb crafts movement and traces the legacy of the college's distinctive style from its roots through its enduring tradition.</p><p>Suzanne Ormond, a native of New Orleans, was an established potter and craftswoman and owner of a pottery manufacturing business. Widely recognized as an authority on the Newcomb movement, Ormond became interested in Newcomb art while a student at the Newcomb Art School. Prior to her death in February 2004, Ormond was a preservationist and active civic leader in New Orleans. She served on the New Orleans Public Library Board of Directors and was the 1998 recipient of the New Orleans Mayoral Medal of Honor.</p><p>Mary E. Irvine, now deceased, had long been associated with Newcomb, first as a student and later through her sister-in-law, Sadie Irvine, who was the most famous of the Newcomb decorators and who produced pottery at Newcomb College for more than fifty years.</p><p>Together, Mary Irvine and Suzanne Ormond established the foundation that assembled the large collection of crafts of the Newcomb Style currently housed in the Louisiana State Museum. The authors collaborated on their cookbook, Favorite New Orleans Recipes, published by Pelican. Suzanne Ormond is also the author of Pelican's Recipes from an Old New Orleans Kitchen.</p><p></p><p>Decorated with moss-draped live oaks, Louisiana irises, and Southern pines, the crafts created by the ladies of Newcomb College during the first half of the twentieth century represent some of New Orleans' most iconic and distinctive art. Founded as an institution to prepare women to be financially independent community leaders, Newcomb quickly earned international acclaim for the striking variety of pottery, calligraphy, and other crafts produced by the students of its celebrated art department. In this collection of pristine images resides a history of the artwork that established the Newcomb movement as one of critical artistic importance.</p></p><h2>George Soros On Globalization</h2><p>Over the past decade, "globalization" has become a buzzword for everything that is happening in the world economy or even in international relations generally. But as even a cursory glance at recent headlines reveals, not everyone is happy with globalization. Violent protests are now a regular feature of international summit meetings, and many young people have expressed their strong opposition to policies that they see as enriching the rich at the expense of workers, the environment, and traditional culture. <br><br> As the world economy has transformed in the 1990s and early 2000s, no individual has grappled with the social and political implications of globalization more than George Soros. <i>George Soros on Globalization</i> seeks to assess not merely how well the world's financial institutions have fulfilled their larger mission of helping the entire world strive for prosperity, but also to point the way toward fixing the problems that have emerged in the globalization regime as a whole. Unlike other proponents of globalization, Soros does not dismiss the criticisms of the protesters; indeed, he welcomes them and acknowledges that in many ways the protesters have a clearer view of the issues at stake than the bankers and bureaucrats do. We ignore the protesters' message, Soros warns, at our peril.<br></p><p><b>George Soros</b> heads Soros Fund Management and is the founder of a global network of foundations dedicated to supporting open societies. Known throughout the world both for his financial acumen and for his political engagement, Soros is the author of several previous bestselling books including <i>The Alchemy of Finance, The Crisis of Global Capitalism</i>, and <i>Open Society</i>.Financial mastermind Soros (The Alchemy of Finance, etc.) has made his mark as a philanthropist with a progressive foreign policy, fostering open societies. He equates globalization with "the free movement of capital and the increasing domination of national economies by global financial markets and multinational corporations." In this treatise, he explains how his vision to "make global capitalism more stable and equitable" acknowledges that antiglobalization protesters have a case against the mainstream consensus that the market works well. Instead of dismantling existing international financial and trade institutions, though, Soros suggests reform. Market fundamentalists, he says, are unwilling to modify existing institutions to create a level playing field; moreover, they're loath to create institutions to foster social goals like reducing poverty. Protestors, he observes, are "strangely blind" to the need to improve the quality of government and public life in poorer countries. Soros's suggested method provides aid that will "enable, encourage, and reinforce" voluntary compliance with international standards relating to environment, education and labor. His proposal? The richer countries in the IMF issue Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) for international assistance i.e., international reserve assets a process that shares the burden equitably, with the United States paying its fair share. A board of "eminent persons" chooses who's eligible for assistance, and a separate audit commission evaluates those chosen. After September 11, Soros notes in conclusion, Americans must recognize the world's precarious interdependence. Soros has an admirable track record and the virtue of hindsight (his foundations have done innovative work and his take on what could have been done in Russia over the past decade is compelling). This dry but vital book deserves attention and debate. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Place of Safety</h2><p>When Lionel Lawrence opens his rambling rectory to rehabilitate young offenders he has no idea of the consequences, least of all that they will include blackmail and murder.

For the past twenty years, Australian philosopher and professor of bioethics Peter Singer has pushed the hot buttons of our collective conscience. In addition to writing the book that sparked the modern animal rights movement, Singer has challenged our most closely held beliefs on the sanctity of human life, the moral obligation's of citizens of affluent nations toward those living in the poorest countries of the world, and much more, with arguments that intrigue as often and as powerfully as they incite.</p><p><em>Writings On An Ethical Life</em> offers a comprehensive collection of Singer's best and most provocative writing, as chosen by Singer himself. Among the controversial subjects addressed are the moral status of animals, environmental account-ablility, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, and the ultimate choice of living an ethical life. This book provides an unsurpassed one-volume view of both the underpinnings and the applications of Singer's governing philosophy.</p></p><p>Peter Singer's arguments have penetrating moral accountability that can be quite unnerving to the reader who is expecting an afternoon on the couch with a cup of coffee and a book. In fact, words like <i>influential</i>, <i>controversial</i>, and much less flattering adjectives are invariably appended to his name. There is no doubt that the first two titles apply, but whether he is deserving of the less flattering adjectives remains for readers of this book to decide. <i>Writings on an Ethical Life</i> collects his thoughts on practical ethics over the last 30 years into a single volume. Singer begins from the premise that "the whole point of ethical judgments is to guide practice," which may not seem very remarkable nowadays, but in its day was virtually anathema to academic ethicists, who preferred abstract theorizing to practical moral reasoning.<p> Singer first gained eminence for his profoundly important early work on animal rights, arguing convincingly for vegetarianism and against the commonplace cruel treatment of animals by large commercial interests. However, he has probably attracted the most notoriety for his much-maligned writings in defense of abortion rights and certain forms of euthanasia. Singer is frequently misunderstood, misquoted, and demonized. Ironically, the ferocity of his detractors--particularly during his appointment as DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University--has generated nearly unheard-of exposure for an academic philosopher. While a small portion of Singer's work has been catapulted into the limelight, lay audiences have often overlooked other equally important ideas--unfortunate, because he is a wonderfully plainspoken and powerful writer: "Where so many are in such great need, indulgence in luxury is not morally neutral, and the fact that we have not killed anyone is not enough to make us morally decent citizens of the world." It is no wonder Singer is so controversial and influential. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p><p>Peter Singer's other books include <em>Writings on an Ethical Life</em>, <em>Practical Ethics</em>, and <em>The Life You Can Save</em>, among many others. He is the Ira W.

As reward, Lawrence, the old man, leads Michael to a treasure cave that only the innocent can enter, telling him to leave the silver and gold, but to take the blue light if he finds it. Michael does, Lawrence disappears, and the spirit of the lamp does Michael's bidding, including bringing a princess, nightly, to his room. Finding out, the king orders Michael's death.

Doth he not mend?<br>&#x2014;TWELFTH NIGHT, ACT 1, SCENE 5<br>The sun rose through the gap in the eastern ridge where the river cuts through. I watched it come up, lying on my back on the riverbank. A few months ago, I had prayed that God would grant me the gift of seeing one more sunrise. He had granted that prayer, along with a few others, in a manner more generous than my situation merited, but that&#x2019;s the sort of thing He does. I make no pretense of understanding His ways, but ever since I survived that dreadful night, I&#x2019;ve made a point of trying to see every sunrise that I could. And I&#x2019;ve continued to pray. Not for myself, mind you. I&#x2019;ve been rewarded enough so that I can pass along some prayers for the rest of the world. It seems only fair.<br>As the warmth of the rays began removing the night&#x2019;s chill from my limbs, I took my right knee, brought it to my chest, and held it there for a slow count of ten. Then I did the same with the left knee, though the leg protested vehemently. Pain coursed through it, rounding the turns at my ankles and surging back toward my hip until I released it, gasping. Then I repeated the exercise, right knee without pain, left with.<br>I sat up, kept my right leg straight, and brought it up by degrees until it was pointing to the sky. I let it drop, then looked at my left leg as if it belonged to some stranger, one who had yet to earn my trust. Reluctantly, I grabbed it and started pulling it up.<br>I couldn&#x2019;t get it to the vertical, and had to settle for the diagonal. I thought I could hear the scar tissue cracking, but that may have been my imagination. I let it go and stood up.<br>Roosters crowed on the farms surrounding the town. I stripped to my linens and dove into the river, kicking hard. The water came directly from the snow still visible on the distant mountain peaks, pausing on its way to the nearby Adriatic to chill me to the marrow. I made it across to the opposite bank, then swam back. I did five circuits before the left leg gave up; then I dragged myself back up the bank like a shipwrecked sailor. Not bad, I thought. Only four months since a bolt from a crossbow had fixed my thigh to a wall, one month since I could walk without crutches. Lucky I still had a leg to stand on.<br>I dried myself off, donned my motley, and rubbed the flour-chalk mixture onto my face until it took on its normal macabre aspect. Kohl for the brows and lines, rouge for the lips and cheeks, then malachite for the green diamonds under the eyes. Finally, the cap and bells on my head, and I was ready to face the world again.<br>&#x201c;Good morning, Fool,&#x201d; said a woman behind me.<br>I spun, startled; then I relaxed and bowed.<br>&#x201c;Good morning, milady,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I trust you slept well.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Quite well, thank you, Feste,&#x201d; replied Viola. &#x201c;I am ready for my lesson.&#x201d;<br>She glanced around and made sure that no one was near. Then she walked up to me, placed her arms around my neck, and kissed me.<br>&#x201c;There, you&#x2019;ve gone and smeared my makeup,&#x201d; I protested, admittedly some minutes later.<br>Viola stepped back and surveyed the damage. &#x201c;I suppose some of it got on me,&#x201d; she said. I nodded. She pulled out a handkerchief and wiped her face while I made repairs to mine. &#x201c;The perils of kissing a fool,&#x201d; she remarked. &#x201c;I had no idea that loving someone so simple would be so complicated. How is your leg today?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Improving. Still weak and stiff, but less than before. Now, my lovely apprentice, let&#x2019;s see how you&#x2019;ve progressed.&#x201d;<br>She took three balls out of a bag and started juggling.<br>&#x201c;Good. Switch hands.&#x201d;<br>She shifted the pattern from a left-handed start to a right-handed one.<br>&#x201c;Good. Two and one. Other way. Over the top. Excellent. Overhand grabs, now. Have you tried going under the leg?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In my room,&#x201d; she said, concentrating on the pattern. &#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t do it here in this gown. Oh, dear.&#x201d; A ball dropped out of her reach and rolled toward the bank. I retrieved it before it plunged into the river and handed it back to her. &#x201c;Why did you go over there?&#x201d; she asked it sternly.<br>&#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s where you threw it,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Start over.&#x201d;<br>She sighed and sent them aloft. &#x201c;When do I start on four balls?&#x201d;<br>I tossed another one at her. She wasn&#x2019;t expecting it. She made a late grab, and three of the four balls ended up at her feet.<br>&#x201c;When you&#x2019;ve mastered three,&#x201d; I answered.<br>&#x201c;Yes, Teacher.&#x201d;<br>She went back to work while I resumed my stretching.<br>&#x201c;That trick won&#x2019;t work on me again, you know,&#x201d; she said, tossing one behind her back and catching it over the opposite shoulder.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s today&#x2019;s lesson,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;A good fool is ready for anything at any time. We&#x2019;ll start on four balls tomorrow. In the meantime, switch to clubs. When you&#x2019;re ready, we&#x2019;ll work on some four-handed moves.&#x201d;<br>I stopped and listened. &#x201c;Do you hear that?&#x201d;<br>She nodded, pulling three gaily painted clubs out of her bag. &#x201c;Someone singing.

Then he moved on and repeated it.<br>Thus it was that I heard in the distance a sweet tenor soaring over the faint strummings of a lute:<br>How sweet to meet the soft-lit Dawn<br>When the world lies still aborning.<br>Farewell, Philomel, I must move on.<br>I have miles to go this morning.<br>I cleared my throat and sang out in the direction of my unknown friend:<br>Yet stay, I pray, my pretty Faun,<br>Or my love you will be scorning.<br>The Sun will run, and then be gone.<br>Let tomorrow&#x2019;s Dawn be our warning.<br>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t the second part be sung by a woman?&#x201d; asked Viola, keeping her eyes on the clubs dancing in the air over her head.<br>&#x201c;When one&#x2019;s available,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Now, hush, Apprentice.&#x201d;<br>Tantalo once told me that the art of being a troubadour is to sing, play the lute, and look magnificent in a cape, all while simultaneously riding a horse. And there he was, the embodiment of his own definition, perched on a beautiful, black, Spanish stallion prancing daintily down the hill, both horse and rider bedecked in black-and-red checkered silks. His Insouciance guided his steed without reins, leaving his hands free to continue plucking away at a lute that was far nicer than mine. His horse, I swear, kept time with its hooves. They descended the slope toward us. When they stopped, Tantalo swung his leg over the saddle and leaped lightly to the ground, continuing the melodic line in the lute without break.<br>&#x201c;You must teach me how to do that trick,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in fine voice this morning.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This morning, this afternoon, yesterday and tomorrow,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;You, on the other hand, sound a touch hoarse.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been swimming,&#x201d; I said, a bit defensively.<br>He turned, doffed his plumed hat, and nodded to Viola, then turned back to me.<br>&#x201c;Introduce me to your charming companion, if you would be so kind.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Viola, this is Tantalo, an old friend. Tantalo, this is my apprentice, Viola.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Apprentice?&#x201d; he said in surprise. He leaned toward me and muttered, &#x201c;Looks a bit long in the tooth for an apprentice, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br>I reached forward and caught a club an inch away from his skull.<br>&#x201c;Oops,&#x201d; said Viola sweetly, keeping the other two clubs going with her right hand. I tossed back the wandering third. She caught it adroitly and continued practicing.<br>&#x201c;Rather ungallant for a troubadour, commenting on a lady&#x2019;s age,&#x201d; I admonished him.<br>&#x201c;Oh, a lady, is she? Forgive me. I mistook her for a fool&#x2019;s apprentice. As a Guild member, it is my right and obligation to insult apprentices, and their responsibility to come up with some witty retort.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re funny-looking, and your horse smells,&#x201d; Viola called out.<br>&#x201c;All right, so that part needs work,&#x201d; I said hastily. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s no ordinary apprentice. She&#x2019;s fluent in nine languages, sings and plays beautifully, and is a superb actress and mimic. I can vouch for that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, if you say so,&#x201d; he said, somewhat dubiously. &#x201c;Anyhow, that is not my business here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What is your business?&#x201d;<br>He straightened up and puffed out his chest. &#x201c;Theophilos, I have traveled from the Guildhall to Venice, and by boat from Venice to Capodistria, and then ridden down the Adriatic coast-line to this lovely town of Orsino, to ask you but a single question: how is your leg?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is that personal or official?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Both.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Personally, it hurts like hell. Officially, I can no longer do a standing back flip, and I still limp fairly badly, but I am otherwise back to my old self.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said, nodding. &#x201c;Your report of your success here was duly noted. Father Gerald was so delighted, he was observed to kick up one heel. More cannot be expected of such an ancient. But you are back in his good graces.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hooray for me. What does the Guild want?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Now, now, gossip before business. You know the rules.&#x201d;<br>I debated with myself over whether or not I would intercept the next club flung in his direction. He pulled out a large handkerchief, opened it with a flourish, and placed it on the ground. He then sat upon it and leaned forward.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never guess, my friend, who showed up at the court in Hagenau recently.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been in Germany in years. Tell me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Alexios.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Which Alexios?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Alexios of Constantinople. Son of the usurped and blinded Isaakios, former emperor. Nephew of the usurping and blinding Alexios the Third, current emperor. Alexios, who seeks to become Alexios the Fourth, the next emperor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Which would be a neat trick, considering his father and uncle both live. When did he escape?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sometime in the fall, we think.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And this was not the Guild&#x2019;s doing?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;By David&#x2019;s lyre, no. The Guild has no interest in disrupting the Byzantine throne. The results are too unpredictable, and besides, they do a fine job of that all by themselves. The immediate agents who arranged his escape were Pisan, but we suspect his sister Irene was behind it. She&#x2019;s married to Philip of Swabia, you know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He escapes, goes north to big sister, and has a ready-made entry to the German court. What does that have to do with the Guild?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s this little matter of the Crusade gathering in Venice.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Which is going to Constantinople, according to Domino.&#x201d;<br>He shrugged. &#x201c;Maybe. Domino&#x2019;s been the chief fool in Venice forever, and usually knows which way the wind&#x2019;s blowing. But not everyone in the Guild thinks Constantinople is the intended target. There&#x2019;s a whole lot of French and Flemish soldiers sworn to liberate the Holy Land, and nothing but the Holy Land. Then there are some who want to invade Egypt first, one infidel territory being just as good as the next. So, most of us thought Constantinople was a long shot. But Alexios&#x2019;s arrival complicates matters. You know who else was at Hagenau? Boniface of Montferrat. Here the Guild is, making every effort to keep the Crusaders from slaughtering Christians, at the very least, and now the commander is meeting with the chief claimant to the Byzantine throne.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the Guild doing about it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The usual. The troubadours are in a tricky position. Unlike you, we can&#x2019;t just go around making fun of our patrons. We&#x2019;re supposed to be out there singing their praises. And if the particular lord is taking the Cross and swearing to bring an army with him, then we&#x2019;re supposed to be out rousing the rabble. So, we roused them. Now that we&#x2019;ve roused them, we&#x2019;re trying to douse them. Lyrics that once glorified the noble quest now speak of the girl we leave behind. Some of our gallants are becoming homesick before they even depart.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re also taking the opposite tack of inflaming their fervor to such a pitch that they must to Beyond-the-Sea immediately. Several hundred have skipped Venice altogether and dashed off to Apulia, which is doing a nice business in transporting them. They&#x2019;ll arrive in inadequate numbers to fight the Mohammedans, while depriving their Venetian-bound comrades of their promised numbers. We&#x2019;re hoping that not enough of them show up in Venice to justify the journey. In Venice itself, we&#x2019;re spreading rumors that the Crusade is being subverted to Venetian ends. Some of those who came there because they took the Cross are now crying betrayal and going home.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well done. But it won&#x2019;t work. Venice has committed too much of its monies to this expedition. If they don&#x2019;t get repaid with profit, they won&#x2019;t be happy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Agreed. And just when we were hoping everything might fall apart nicely, along comes little Alexios with his big requests. Oh, you should see how grown men and women weep to hear of his travels and travails. Fortunately, Rome won&#x2019;t support him. Innocent may be one of the most conniving popes in recent memory, but even he won&#x2019;t absolve an attack like this. Unfortunately, events have their own momentum, which is why the Guild wants you to go to Constantinople.&#x201d;<br>I was waiting for it, I was expecting it, and he still managed to sneak it in and wallop me.<br>&#x201c;Constantinople? Me? Now?&#x201d; I almost shouted.<br>He looked at me and shook his head sadly. &#x201c;Theo, you have to do better than one-word questions if you&#x2019;re to uphold your reputation as a wit. But to respond in the same manner: Yes. You. Now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But doesn&#x2019;t the Guild have half a dozen people there already?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We did,&#x201d; he replied.<br>Suddenly, I was afraid. &#x201c;What happened to them?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said slowly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;d like you to find out. They&#x2019;ve disappeared. All of them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dead?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know. We received word from Fat Basil in Thessaloniki. The troubadour riding the circuit from Constantinople reported that all of the fools had vanished without explanation. He left, saying he would try to find out what happened. That&#x2019;s the last we heard.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When was this?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe six or seven months ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who did the Guild have working there?&#x201d;<br>He counted on his fingers. &#x201c;The dwarf brothers were with the Emperor. Thalia was with the Empress. Tiberius and Demetrios worked the streets, the Hippodrome, and the Great Palace. The troubadour was called Ignatius.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re using the past tense. About people that I know.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then I hope that you may know them again. Thalia was a particular friend of yours, was she not?&#x201d;<br>Some troubadours should stick to singing. When they talk, they just get people in trouble. I glanced over at Viola, but she was absorbed in her juggling, some distance away.<br>&#x201c;When can you leave?&#x201d; Tantalo asked.<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a complication,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m married,&#x201d; I replied, indicating Viola. &#x201c;Meet the Duchess.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Married?&#x201d; he guffawed. &#x201c;Well, my goodness. Congratulations, I suppose.&#x201d; He turned to Viola. &#x201c;And to you, Apprentice.&#x201d; She nodded, and he turned back. &#x201c;I guess . . .&#x201d; Then his jaw slowly dropped in the first uncalculated expression I had ever seen on him. &#x201c;When you said, &#x2018;Duchess,&#x2019; you meant . . . Good God, Theo, you&#x2019;ve rejoined the gentry!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dragged me down to his level, more the like,&#x201d; said Viola.<br>He got up and swept his hat off in a superb bow.<br></p><h2>African Hunter</h2><p>Generally regarded as the most comprehensive title ever on African hunting.

As husband, father and successful lawyer, his life was an American success story. But that was only the surface. Underneath, unprotected by old money and social standing lay sexual secrets that, even in death, could tear apart a family, and a town.</p><p><p><b>John O&#x2019;Hara&nbsp;</b>(1905&#x2013;1970) was one of the most prominent American writers of the twentieth century.

He lives in New York.</p><p><b>PART ONE</b></p><p>Edith Chapin was alone in her sewing room on the third floor of the house at Number 10 in Frederick Street. The room was warm, the day was cold and unbrightened by the sun. The shutters in the bay-window were closed, but the slats in the shutters were open, and Edith Chapin could, when it pleased her, go to the bay-window and look down on her yard and the two-story garage that had been a stable, and above and beyond the gilded figure of a trotting horse on the weather vane she could see roof upon roof upon third story upon third story of the houses on the rising hill. She would know the names of nearly all of the people who lived in them, she knew the names of the owners. She had spent her lifetime in the town, and it was easy to know who everyone was and where everyone lived. It was especially easy for Edith because she had always had a reputation for shyness, and it was not expected of her to make a fuss over people. She could notice them and study them, if it pleased her, without any further social effort on her part than simple politeness called for. It had always been that way.</p><p>At a gentle knock on her sewing-room door&#x2014;two knocks, not an unnecessary third&#x2014;Edith Chapin cleared her throat and said, gently, &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; Her enunciation was slow and precise.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, ma&#x2019;am. Mary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; said Edith Chapin.</p><p>Mary was an Irishwoman from Glasgow with a clear skin and brown eyes full of self-respect behind her tortoise-shell spectacles. Her bust was abundant and her waist not thick.</p><p>&#x201c;What is it, Mary?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Mr. Hooker, the newspaper editor, wants to see you, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To see me? Is he here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. I put him in the sitting room.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Alone, or is Mrs. Hooker with him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody with him, just himself,&#x201d; said Mary.</p><p>&#x201c;Are there a lot of other people down there?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s quite a crush, ma&#x2019;am, sitting and talking. There isn&#x2019;t chairs for all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know. Did anyone offer Mr. Hooker a chair?&#x201d; said Edith Chapin.</p><p>&#x201c;Not by the time I left. I come right up. Maybe somebody did offer him one since.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mm-hmm.&#x201d; Edith Chapin nodded. &#x201c;This is what I&#x2019;d like you to do, Mary.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go downstairs, and if Mr. Hooker isn&#x2019;t sitting with someone, if he&#x2019;s just standing with the others, you go up to him and ask him if you can speak to him for a moment. Then when you get him out in the hall, tell him I&#x2019;ll see him. But if he&#x2019;s sitting down with some people&#x2014;You see, I don&#x2019;t want to make an exception for anybody. I haven&#x2019;t seen anybody, as you know. But I think I ought to see Mr. Hooker. Such a good friend of Mr. Chapin&#x2019;s.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A great admirer of Mr. Chapin&#x2019;s. Great. The article yesterday, it made you realize if you didn&#x2019;t already.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s why I would like to make an exception in his case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Will I bring you a cup of tea, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no thanks. I don&#x2019;t want him to stay that long. Remember now, if he&#x2019;s sitting down with the others, don&#x2019;t single him out. But if he&#x2019;s standing, it&#x2019;ll look as though he had an appointment with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand perfectly, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said Mary.</p><p>&#x201c;You can bring me a cup of tea after he&#x2019;s gone. I&#x2019;d like a cup of tea and two soft-boiled eggs. Some toast and some of that grape jelly, if there&#x2019;s any left.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a whole new jar I opened.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, then there was some more. I was sure we had some left. Where did you find it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was in with the currant, on that shelf. It didn&#x2019;t have the label on it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s where it was. And some cigarettes when you bring the tea. It might be a good idea if you put the cigarettes under a napkin. Some of the older ladies . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said Mary, and left.</p><p>Edith Chapin composed herself in the ladderback rocking chair, and was so arranged a few minutes later when Mary&#x2019;s knock came again. She knocked twice, and waited, then knocked twice again.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; Edith Chapin called out.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, ma&#x2019;am, with Mr. Hooker,&#x201d; said Mary.</p><p>&#x201c;Come in, please,&#x201d; said Edith Chapin.</p><p>Mary swung the door open, making way for the man. &#x201c;Mr. Hooker, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Robert,&#x201d; said Edith Chapin.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Edith.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary closed the door behind her.</p><p>Robert Hooker went to Edith Chapin and took her extended hand in his two. &#x201c;Edith, I call myself a dealer in words, but today I have none to offer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Today, but not yesterday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you saw my editorial?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If I hadn&#x2019;t seen it on my own&#x2014;you have no idea how many people called up about it. Joe would have been&#x2014;well, pleased is hardly the word. I consider it one of the finest pieces of writing I&#x2019;ve ever read, and not only because it was about Joe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was from the heart, Edith.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes. Yes,&#x201d; said Edith Chapin.</p><p>&#x201c;The Bar Association is having it reprinted, I thought you&#x2019;d like to know. Henry Laubach called up this morning and ordered a thousand cards, about the size of a postcard, with my small tribute to Joe printed on them. I feel signally honored, but it&#x2019;s a pretty empty honor, when I think of&#x2014;well, I wish the occasion hadn&#x2019;t arose. Arisen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Joe was very fond of you, Robert.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I always hoped so. We didn&#x2019;t see nearly enough of each other. In this crazy old newspaper business, I work in my shirt-sleeves, you know. Joe, the soul of dignity. Not what they call a stuffed shirt, by any means. But as I said in my editorial, the very presence of Joseph B. Chapin in a courtroom provided the room with the dignity one associates with the court of law, but so often lacking in these days of spectacular circus tactics.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Joe would have liked that, every word of it. The dignity of the law was precious to him,&#x201d; said Edith Chapin.</p><p>&#x201c;How are <i>you</i>, Edith? That&#x2019;s a foolish question, of course. What must be going on inside, but I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s a man or woman in town that expected you to behave any differently than you are. It&#x2019;s a rare sight to see such courage in these days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Courage?&#x201d; said Edith Chapin. &#x201c;I have no courage, Robert. I am so used to living the kind of life I&#x2019;ve led that now, at a time like this, it&#x2019;s one advantage of having a naturally retiring disposition. I&#x2019;ve always lived for my husband and my family, nothing else. No outside interests, no hobbies, really. So that now, if I were to make some display of how I am feeling, it wouldn&#x2019;t be at all typical of me, would it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Even my friendships, they had to come through my husband. If they were friends of his, they could be friends of mine, but I was thinking this very morning how few women friends I have. Oh, I like women, I have nice relationships with the members of my sex. I suppose I&#x2019;m as womanly a woman as the word could mean. But when you have reached my age&#x2014;and you know how old I am, Robert. But as I was saying, if you&#x2019;ve lived in a town all your life, except for boarding school, you would think I might have formed some close friendships with women of my age and so on. But the truth is, so many men came to this house, clients and friends and associates and men in the political world, that I neglected my contacts with my women friends. Do you know that outside the family, I haven&#x2019;t received a single woman acquaintance in the past three days?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A great symbol of your devotion to your husband, Edith.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I hope it will be taken for that, and not as an indication that I don&#x2019;t like the members of my own sex, and don&#x2019;t interest myself in their problems, because I do. When things settle down here I&#x2019;m going to have to find something to do with my time. I have no idea what <i>sort</i> of thing I&#x2019;ll do, but I imagine anything I do will involve working with other women, and I don&#x2019;t want to start with any more handicaps than I have already.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have no handicap in whatever you do,&#x201d; said Hooker. &#x201c;Whatever you decide to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s nice of you, but you forget my&#x2014;shyness,&#x201d; said Edith Chapin. &#x201c;Whenever I had to go to any public function with Joe, oh, it was sheer torture. I was always afraid. Not afraid I&#x2019;d do the wrong thing, or say the wrong thing. I think one&#x2019;s natural instincts or upbringing carry one through. But my&#x2014;<i>reserve</i>&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what I was afraid might be misunderstood. Has it been, Robert?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not one bit. Not one bit. I know the people of this town. I know what they think. I know how they feel. It&#x2019;s my business to know. And I can reassure you on that point. Your what you call shyness and reserve, that&#x2019;s one of the things that has endeared you to them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Joe was so good with people. He could mix with them and be friendly, to the exact degree that he wanted to be. He really could handle people, couldn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of his greatest gifts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was hard for him, too, you know,&#x201d; said Edith Chapin.</p><p>&#x201c;It was, Edith?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Joe was not naturally gregarious. When we were first married, I think it was before you moved here, Joe confined himself to the people he grew up with. Two or three friends that we saw a great deal of, and as a matter of fact, Joe actually used to seem to prefer the company of older men. Judge Larkin. Old Mr. English, Doctor English&#x2019;s father, that is. And they seemed to enjoy his company, too. It was a great change when he decided to enter public life. He had to force himself to be patient and tolerant of other people. But I remember his saying to me later on, how he&#x2019;d been missing a lot of fun out of life by not getting about more in his young manhood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never knew that, Edith. I never knew that. I would have said that Joe Chapin was one of the greatest mixers I ever saw.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And he was, but he had to learn it. It wasn&#x2019;t the natural thing for him to do, the way it is with some men. He practically made a study of it. But of course Joe had one thing I never have had. Confidence. Complete confidence in himself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The aristocrat, in the better sense,&#x201d; said Hooker.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, of course he didn&#x2019;t like that word, but I&#x2019;m inclined to agree with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have it too, Edith.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no. Not a bit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think so. I think you have. You may be shy, but I&#x2019;ve watched you, I&#x2019;ve studied you. You may not be the outgoing type, the extrovert, but people know that underneath that shyness is a woman of great courage and principle. Look at you now. If they could see you now they&#x2019;d know they were right. It&#x2019;s a great honor for me, you letting me have these few moments to pay my respects.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder why I let myself prattle on this way. I&#x2019;ve talked with you more than any other person. In fact, I haven&#x2019;t really talked to anyone else at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a great honor for me. I suppose we newspaper men, we&#x2019;re told so many things in confidence, there must be something about us that makes people trust us.&#x201d;</p><p>Edith Chapin hesitated. &#x201c;It must be more than that, too,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Thank you for coming to see me. It was very kind of you. And later, when things&#x2014;settle down&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going to ask you for some advice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am at your service.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And remember me to Kitty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She wanted to come with me, but I was sure there&#x2019;d be too many people. By the way, I had a very pleasant visit with Joe Junior downstairs. Amazing, how much like his father.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, at least in appearance. They&#x2019;re really quite different.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I meant. This is a grand old house, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Full of memories, happy ones and sad ones.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The way a house should be,&#x201d; said Hooker.</p><p>&#x201c;Frederick Street isn&#x2019;t fashionable any more, but it&#x2019;s much more convenient than Lantenengo Street. We&#x2019;ve always had the noise and the smoke from the trains, and some of the neighbors on William Street leave a lot to be desired, but we&#x2019;re used to it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A speaking tube. I guess there aren&#x2019;t many houses left with a speaking tube.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it has all those things. I suppose you noticed the dumbwaiter. And on the second floor, the busybody.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had a story about busybodies last year. I sent one of my reporters out and he counted I think eighty-seven left in the whole town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When I was a girl I don&#x2019;t suppose there were eighty-seven houses that <i>didn&#x2019;t</i> have one,&#x201d; said Edith Chapin. She smiled her sad smile and Robert Hooker went to her and shook her hand in both of his.</p><p>&#x201c;You are very brave, Edith Chapin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;And call me for anything, anything at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you again, Robert,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>He braced his shoulders like the National Guard lieutenant he once had been, and marched out of the sewing room. She waited until she heard his step on the second-floor landing, then went to the speaking tube and blew the whistle.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said Mary.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m ready, Mary,&#x201d; said Edith Chapin.</p><p>� � �</p><p>The will of Joseph B. Chapin contained no surprises. It was an orderly document, meant to be read in public. Certain sums were to be paid to servants and charities, and those sums were specified in dollars, but the bulk of the estate was in stocks, bonds, and mortgages, identified by name or location.</p><p>The sum of $100,000 was to be paid to the son, Joseph Benjamin Chapin Junior, and a like sum to the daughter, Ann Chapin. The remainder was to be used to create a trust fund for the widow, Edith Chapin. Upon her death the fund was to be divided equally between the son and the daughter. Personal items such as cuff links, cigarette cases, pearl studs, watches, watch chains were to be the property of the widow, but it was suggested that they might be distributed among friends: Chapin&#x2019;s law partner, his physician, the steward of the Gibbsville Club and the first, as yet unborn, grandson.</p><p>Edith Chapin, as she always had been, was a woman in comfortable circumstances. Now, in fact, in 1945, she was in more than comfortable circumstances. She was rich. But it would not be known that she was rich. The details of her wealth were known to only a few persons, who were not likely to discuss those details with others not privileged to have the information. The directors of her bank would know, her husband&#x2019;s law partner would know, the county Register of Wills would know. But there was no gossip value in the size of Joe Chapin&#x2019;s estate or the terms of his will. He had left more money than anyone had expected him to leave, but not so much more that the amount was sensational. If he had died poor, or enormously wealthy, the public, the public curiosity would have had to be satisfied. He had not died poor, and only a little richer (and that was to be expected of a man like Joe Chapin); consequently there would be no dislocation of the Chapin family status, and the status had always been described as in comfortable circumstances. There was a butcher on the West Side of town who had less money than Edith Chapin, who lived on the East Side of town. The butcher had a Cadillac, and so had Edith Chapin, but the butcher&#x2019;s was newer. The butcher&#x2019;s son was studying for the priesthood and was no great drain on his father&#x2019;s income; but Joe Chapin Junior was not studying for the priesthood, and he would be no great drain on his mother&#x2019;s income. The 18th Street butcher was said to be getting rich; the Frederick Street widow was said to be in comfortable circumstances.</p><p>The butcher was not in attendance at the funeral of Joseph Benjamin Chapin, which took place in Trinity Church. The butcher and Joe Chapin never had spoken a...</p></p><h2>Too Big to Fall: America&#39;s Failing Infrastructure and the Way Forward</h2><p>In August 2007, the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 145 others. Investigations following the tragedy revealed that it was not an unavoidable accident, but one that could have been prevented&#x2014;and one that threatens to be repeated at many thousands of bridges located across the nation. Already more than 50 percent of our bridges are past their intended lifespan. Using the I-35W Bridge as a starting point, LePatner chronicles the problems that led to that catastrophe&#x2014;poor bridge design, shoddy maintenance, ignored expert recommendations for repair, and misallocated funding&#x2014;and then explores the responses to the tragedy, including the NTSB document which failed to report the full story to our nation. <br><br>From here LePatner evaluates what the I-35W Bridge collapse means for the country as a whole&#x2014;outlining the possibility of a nationwide infrastructure breakdown. He exposes government failure on a national as well as state level, uncovering how our nation&#x2019;s transportation system prioritizes funding for new projects over maintenance funding for aging infrastructure. He explains the imperatives for why we must maintain an effective infrastructure system, and how it plays a central role in supporting both our nation&#x2019;s economic strength and our national security. <br><br>Written both for those who can effect change and for those who must demand it, Too Big to Fall presents an eye-opening critique of a bureaucratic system that has allowed political best interests to trump those of the American people.</p><p>BARRY B. LePATNER is the founder of LePatner &amp; Associates LLP, which serves as legal and business advisor to corporations, institutions, and developers. He is the author of Broken Buildings, Busted Budgets: How to Fix America&#x2019;s Trillion-Dollar Construction Industry.The deadly collapse of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis awakened Americans to the perils of our aging infrastructure, but as LePatner points out, it was a disaster years in the making. In this painstaking analysis of both the Minneapolis tragedy and other structural failures, he reveals that government failures at every level have resulted in our reliance on roads and bridges that were never designed to sustain the volume of traffic we now generate. Politics plays a huge part here, but so does the problem of keeping the public interested in a vital yet dull subject. Citing Willa Cather&#x2019;s Alexander&#x2019;s Bridge, LePatner points out that &#x201c;engineers were once a type of American cultural hero.&#x201d; Poems were written about them; they remade the landscape and transformed the country. That was the era of &#x201c;steel and concrete,&#x201d; however, when expansion was the story that mattered. LaPatner makes it clear that today&#x2019;s problems of management and maintenance are just as important, and require a similar commitment. Detailed and determined, this is a call to arms ignored at our own peril. --Colleen Mondor</p><h2>King of the Hill: A Memoir</h2><p>An autobiographical novel portrays the author&#39;s youthful days in St. Louis during the thirties and the impact of family and friends on his values and beliefs</p><p></p><h2>Theaetetus</h2><p>Clean, bright used copy with tight binding.

He smelled the living earth in the dead of winter. In the distance mournful blasts of a vessel departing the harbor. Ah, if I could go where it's going. He wrestles to sleep again but can't, unease like a horse dragging him by both bound legs out of bed. I've got to get up to write, otherwise there's no peace in me. In this regard I have no choice. "My God, the years." He flings aside the blanket and standing unsteadily by the loose-legged chair that holds his clothes slowly draws on his cold pants. Today's another day. Lesser dresses unwillingly, disappointing surprise, because he had gone to bed in a fire of desire to write in the morning. His thoughts were sweet, impatient for tomorrow. He goes to sleep in anticipation and wakes resistant, mourning. For what? Whom? What useless dreams intervene? Though he remembers none although his sleep is stuffed with dreams, Lesserreveries one touched with fear: Here's this stranger I meet on the stairs. "Who you looking for, brother?" "Who you callin brother, mother?" Exit intruder. Yesterday's prowler or already today's? Levenspiel in disguise? A thug he's hired to burn or blow up the joint? It's my hyperactive imagination working against the grain. Lesser makes things hard for himself for certain reasons. That's a long tale but right now it means he doesn't know how to end his book. Nor why the ending, this time, is so hard to come by if you've invented every step that leads to it, though some crumble when you look hard at them. Still, it's bound to come, it always has. Maybe it's some kind of eschatological dodge? Like an end is more than I can stand? Each book I write nudges me that much closer to death? As soon as he ends one he begins another. Now that the imagination is imagining Lesser imagines it done, the long labor concluded at last. Relief, calm, mornings in bed for a month. Dawn on the sea, rose lighting the restless waves touching an island waking, breathing the fresh breath of its trees, flowers, bayberry bushes, seashells. Ah, the once more sensuous smells of land surrounded by the womanly sea. Birds rise from the shore, wheel, fly above the ragged, mast-like palms into the lucent sky. Gulls mewling,sudden storms of blackbirds shrilling over the violet water. Ah, this live earth, this sceptered isle on a silver sea, this Thirty-first Street and Third Avenue. This forsaken house. This happy unhappy Lesser having to write. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> On this cold winter morning when the rusty radiator knocked like a hearty guest but gave off feeble warmth, yesterday's snow standing seven stiff inches on the white street, through which indigenous soot seeped, Harry Lesser, a serious man, strapped his timepiece on his wrist--time also lived on his back--and ran down six dirty flights of the all-but-abandoned, year 1900, faded bulky brick tenement he lived and wrote in. Thirty-five families had evacuated it in the nine months after demolition notices had been mailed but not Lesser, he hung on. Crossing Third against the light, feeling in the street's slush that he had left his rubbers under the sink, Harry, in wet sneakers, popped into a grocery store for his bread, milk, and half dozen apples. As he trotted home he glanced peripherally left and right, then cagily back to see whether his landlord or one of his legal henchmen was hanging around in somebody's wet doorway or crouched behind a snow-roofed car, laying for Lesser. A wasted thought becausewhat could they do but once more try to persuade, and in this matter he is not persuasible. Levenspiel wants him out of the building so he can demolish it and put up another but Levenspiel he holds by the balls. The building was rent-controlled, and from the District Rent Office--they knew him well--Harry had learned he was a statutory tenant with certain useful rights. The others had accepted the landlord's payoff but Lesser stayed on and would for a time so he could finish his book where it was born. Not sentiment, he lived on habit; it saves time. Letting go of Levenspiel's frozen nuts he raced home in the snow. Home is where my book is. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> In front of the decaying brown-painted tenement, once a decent house, Lesser's pleasure dome, he gave it spirit--stood a single dented ash can containing mostly his crap, thousands of torn-up screaming words and rotting apple cores, coffee grinds, and broken eggshells, a literary rubbish can, the garbage of language become the language of garbage. Emptied twice weekly without request; he was grateful. Along the street in front of the house ran a pedestrian pathway through the unshoveled snow. No super for months, gone like a ghost. The heat was automatically controlled,on the sparse side for the lone inhabitant on the top floor, for the last three and a half months Robinson Crusoe up there, the thermostat set in the cellar's bowels by Levenspiel himself. If it pooped out, and it pooped often--the furnace had celebrated its fiftieth birthday--you called the complaint number of Rent and Housing Maintenance, who bedeviled Himself; and in a few hours, if not more, it reluctantly came back on, thanks to the janitor in the pockmarked imitation-Reformation gray job across the street who poked around when Levenspiel begged him on the telephone. Just enough heat to be cold. You saw your inspired breath. Harry had a heater in his study to keep his fingers fluent in the dead of winter, not bad although noisy and costs for electricity. Things could be worse and had been, but he was still a writer writing. Rewriting. That was his forte, he had lots to change--true, too, in his life. Next building on the left had long ago evaporated into a parking lot, its pop art remains, the small-roomed skeletal scars and rabid colors testifying former colorless existence, hieroglyphed on Levenspiel's brick wall; and there was a rumor around that the skinny house on the right, ten thin stories from the 1880's (Mark Twain lived there? ) with a wrought-iron-banistered stoop and abandoned Italian cellar restaurant, was touched for next. Beyond that an old red-brick public school, three stories high, vintage of1903, the curled numerals set like a cameo high on the window-smashed fa�ade, also marked for disappearance. In New York who needs an atom bomb? If you walked away from a place they tore it down. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> In the grimy vestibule Harry obsessively paused at the mailboxes, several maimed, hammered in, some torn out; he set down his grocery bag, his right eye twitching in anticipation of a letter from a publisher he couldn't possibly get until he had completed and sent out his long-suffering manuscript. Reverie: "We have read your new novel and consider it a work of unusual merit. We are honored to publish it." Praise for the book, not for holding out. Lesser had held out, thirty-six, unmarried yet, a professional writer. The idea is to stay a writer. At twenty-four and twenty-seven I published my first and second novels, the first good, the next bad, the good a critical success that couldn't outsell its small advance, the bad by good fortune bought by the movies and kept me modestly at work--enough to live on. Not very much is enough if you've got your mind on finishing a book. My deepest desire is to make my third my best. I want to be thought of as a going concern, not a freak who had published a good first novel and shot his wad. He fished an envelope out of the slot of his mailboxwith both pinkies. If he didn't some curious passer-by would. Lesser knew the handwriting, therefore source and contents: Irving Levenspiel, BBA, CCNY, class of '41, an unfortunate man in form and substance. One supplicatory sentence on thin paper: "Lesser, take a minute to consider reality and so please have mercy." With a nervous laugh the writer tore up the letter. Those he kept were from the rare women who appeared in his life, spring flowers gone in summer; and those from his literary agent, a gray-haired gent who almost never wrote any more. What was there to write about? Nine and a half years on one book is long enough to be forgotten. Once in a while a quasi-humorous inquiry, beginning: "Are you there?", the last three years ago. I don't know where's there but here I am writing. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> He ran with his milk, bread, fruit, up six flights, chewing a cold apple. The small green automatic elevator, built for four, had expired not long ago. The attorney at the rent office had said the landlord must keep up essential services till Lesser moved out or they would order a reduction of his rent, but since he was screwing Levenspiel by staying on, keeping him from tearing down his building, out of mercy Lesser did not complain. So much for mercy. Anyway, climbingstairs was good exercise for somebody who rarely took any. Kept a slim man in shape. The stairs stank a mixed stench, dirt, the dirtiest, urine, vomit, emptiness. He raced up six shadowy flights, lit where he had replaced dead or dying bulbs, they died like flies; and on his floor, breathing short, pushed open the noisy fire door, into a dim, gray-walled, plaster-patched--holes with slaths showing--old-fashioned broad hallway. There were six flats on the floor, three on each side, deserted except for Lesser's habitat on the left as one came into the hall; like turkey carcasses after a festive Thanksgiving, the knobs and locks even, picked off most of the doors by uninvited guests: bums, wet-pants drunks, faceless junkies--strangers in to escape the cold, the snow, and climbed this high up because the sixth floor lies above the fifth. Poor man's Everest, even the maimed aspire, a zoo of homeless selves. Seeking? Not glory but a bedless bed for the small weak hours; who in the morning smashed in a window or two in payment for the night's unrepose--thereafter the wind and rain roamed the unrented flat until somebody boarded the broken glass --ransacking what they could: light fixtures, loose nails, mirrors, closet doors lifted off hinges or left leaning on one; and pissed and shat on the floor instead of the toilet, where it was available. Even some of the bowls were gone, or where unsnatched, their seats removed; for what purpose--hats? firewood?pop art pieces?--in contempt of man's fate? And in the morning stumbled out, escaped into the street before this one or that was by chance unearthed by Levenspiel, up for a long-nosed snoop or pleading visit to his uncooperative writer-tenant, and threatened severely with arrest for unlawful entry and trespass. They disappeared. A smell remains. On the roof was once an attractive small garden where the writer liked to sit after a day's work, breathing, he hoped, as he watched the soiled sky--the moving clouds, and thought of Wm. Wordsworth. Occasionally a patch of blue escaped from somewhere. Gone garden, all gone, disassembled, kidnapped, stolen --the potted flowering plants, window boxes of pansies and geraniums, wicker chairs, even the white six-inch picket fence a civilized tenant had imaginatively put up for those like him who enjoyed a moment's repose this high up in the country. Mr. Holzheimer, a German-born gentleman, originally from Karlsruhe, among those requested to move in the recent past, his six-room apartment next door to Lesser's three, desecrated now, the bedroom walls defaced, torn by graffiti, bespattered with beer, wine, varnish, nameless stains, blots, a crayon cartoon of A. Hitler wearing two sets of sexual organs, malefemale; in a second bedroom a jungle sprouted--huge mysterious trees, white-trunked rising from thick folds, crowding four walls and into the third bedroom, dense ferny underbrush,grasses sharp as razor blades, giant hairy thistles, dwarf palms with saw-toothed rotting leaves, dry thick-corded vines entangling thorny gigantic cactus exuding pus; eye-blinding orchidaceous flowers--plum, red, gold--eating alive a bewildered goat as a gorilla with hand-held penis erectus, and two interested snakes, look on. Deadly jungle. And he, Herr Holzheimer, so gentle, clean, orderly a man. I hope he comes back to haunt the bastards, for a change clean whammying unclean. Lesser tried to scare off the nightcrawlers on his noor--God knows what masked balls go on below--by playing loud his hi-fi at night; and he left every light burning when he went out of an evening. He felt, when he thought of it, a fear of the booming emptiness of the building where whole families had lived and vanished, and strangers came not to stay, but to not stay, a sad fate for an old house. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> A sense of desolation numbed him--something lost in the past--the past?--as he entered his apartment, stoutly protected by two patent locks plus a strong snap-lock enclosing heavy circular bolts. Only when inside his safe-and-sane three rooms Lesser felt himself close off the world and relax. Here is where he forgot all he had to forget to work. He forgot amid bookspacked thick along living room walls of pine shelves he had laboriously built and varnished years ago, mss. of two published novels and one in progress nearing its end, stored in a large carton in the closet; hi-fi equipment, records in stacks and holders on bottom bookcase shelves, other necessary stuff elsewhere in closets, bureau drawers, and medicine chest. His bedroom-study was a large uncluttered room: daybed, narrow dresser, old armchair at the window, floor lamp, short desk plus straight-back chair--all this the evidence and order of life in use. He would not think how much of life he made no attempt to use. That was outside and he was in. Harry, in his small kitchen, refrigerated the milk container and considered a bit of breakfast but gagged at the thought. He had never been one for more than a cup of coffee; had got bread, fruit for later. Really to give himself time to think how the writing might go. The irresistible thing--the thought he wasn't yet at work gave him the shakes--was to get at once to his desk, anchor, gyroscope, magic mt.: it sits there but moves. Long voyage in a small room. There's a longtime book to finish. Coffee he could cook up when he had a pageful of words on paper. You can't eat language but it eases thirst. He entered his three-windowed study, raised the cracked green shades without looking into the streetand arranged himself at his desk. From the top drawer he removed a portion of manuscript. Harry felt a momentary sense of loss, regret at having given his life to writing, followed by a surge of affection for the imaginative self as he read yesterday's page and a half and found it solid, sound, going well. The book redeemed him. Another two or three months ought to finish it. Then a quick last rewrite of the enterprise--call it third-and-a-quarter draft--in about three months, possibly four, and he'd have it made, novel accomplished. Triumph after just ten years. The weight of a decade lay on his head but neither cracked nor crushed--the poor head. Harry felt an impulse to inspect his face in the bathroom mirror, tired gray eyes, often bloodshot, utilitarian lips, wry, thinning, he thought, as the years went by, interested nose, observer too; but successfully resisted. A face is a face: it changes as it faces. The words he writes on paper change it. He was no longer the young man, twenty-seven, who had started this book, nor had any desire to be. Time past is time earned unless the book was badly conceived, constructed, an unknown lemon; then it's dead time. Perish the thought. Lesser, as he wrote, was sometimes a thundering locomotive, all cars attached except caboose, cracking along the clicking tracks into a country whose topography he suspected but did not know till he got there.

He became a painter, draftsman, and lithographer whose work was immersed in famously hedonistic, fin-de-si�cle Paris. In his hands, advertising posters were raised to a high art; he portrayed the nightlife of Montmartre-circuses, caf�s, dance halls, and brothels-with clear, bold color and a certain seamy panache that is instantly recognizable as his. His much mythologized life has found its way into many biographies and into two feature-length movies called <i>Moulin Rouge</i>.</p><p> Lavishly illustrated with 370 color plates, <i>Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre</i> is the first major work to present the artist's oeuvre in the context of Montmartre's lively art scene from roughly 1885 to 1901. Accompanying an exhibition of the same name at the National Gallery of Art and The Art Institute of Chicago, the book features the important paintings, drawings, prints, and posters Toulouse-Lautrec made on Montmartre subjects. It also includes masterpieces by contemporaries he inspired or who inspired him-Degas, Van Gogh, Picasso, and others-as well as rarely seen illustrations, lithographs, photographs, and ephemera of the era. And it discusses the artists, writers, actors, singers, and dancers who formed Toulouse-Lautrec's circle.</p><p> The book's gracefully written essays by Richard Thomson, Phillip Dennis Cate, and Mary Weaver Chapin, with Florence E. Coman, address these themes in light of the rise of the color poster, the proliferation of new forms of entertainment, and the emergence of a celebrity-oriented popular culture. <i>Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre</i> evokes a colorful, chaotic era, and adds a new dimension to our understanding of the art of Toulouse-Lautrec.</p></p><p>The arts community of Paris in the late 19th century has been gutted, stuffed, studied, and fetishized for so many years now that one could easily think there are no mysteries left to wring from this era, as exceptional as it was. This handsome title focuses on the relationship between the ribald, booming, bohemian neighborhood of Montmartre and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's work(1864-1901). It places his art so squarely in context that it rushes back to life and relevance. This is no mean feat, and the picture depicted in these four scholarly and engrossing essays is much clearer, stranger, and more sordid than Hollywood&#x2019;s botched tribute. As discussed in Phillip Dennis Cate's essay, all manner of artists commingled in Lautrec&#x2019;s dens of exploitation (circuses, dancing halls and whorehouses): Nabis, Symbolist, and post-Impressionist painters, absurdist humorists, caricaturists, anarchists, musicians, scene painters, and even proto-conceptual artists. As Mary Weaver Chapin explains, Lautrec was a pop artist before pop, with his appropriations of handbill imagery, his affinity for famous performers, his elevation of the "low" poster medium to "high" art, and his interest in perpetuating his own fame. It's easy to understand the attraction of this era; after all, so many of the cultural seeds of the 20th century were sewn in such a brief time in Paris' 18th <i>arrondissement</i> by (let's face it) a bunch of horny drunk dudes messed up on absinthe. <i>--Mike McGonigal</i><br> <p>"This book will be welcomed by general readers and certainly by visitors to the exhibition, both for deftly integrating its many visual images with accessible writing and for addressing the work of other artists overlooked in previous considerations of Toulouse-Lautrec. This is no small accomplishment."<b>--Gabriel P. Weisberg, University of Minnesota</b><br> </p><br> <p>"<i>Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre</i> offers a major new presentation of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, one that stays clear of the sensationalized biographical focus of earlier approaches. Both through the art it presents and through essays by authors who each bring extensive credentials to their work, it represents a fresh look at Toulouse-Lautrec's art-and at an otherwise little-explored gallery of works and artists who reflect kinship with Toulouse-Lautrec's style and subject matter."<b>--Reinhold Heller, University of Chicago</b><br> </p><br></p><h2>Empire</h2><p>from the series: The Signed First Edition Society, 4 raised bands, satin ribbon, AEG, full gilt embossed tan leather, marbled endpapers, pp. 486, SIGNED by the author</p><p>dal demonstrates a political imagination and insider's sagacity equaled by no other practicing fiction writer I can think of.

Psychoanalysts believe that rebellion guarantees our independence and creative capacities, but is revolution still possible? Confronted with the culture of entertainment, can we build and nurture a culture of revolt, in the etymological and Proustian sense of the word: an unveiling, a return, a displacement, a reconstruction of the past, of memory, of meaning? In the first part of the book, Kristeva examines the manner in which three of the most unsettling modern writers&#x2015;Aragon, Sartre, and Barthes&#x2015;affirm their personal rebellion.<br><br>In the second part of the book, Kristeva ponders the future of rebellion. She maintains that the "new world order" is not favorable to revolt. "What can we revolt against if power is vacant and values corrupt?" she asks. Not only is political revolt mired in compromise among parties whose differences are less and less obvious, but an essential component of European culture&#x2015;a culture of doubt and criticism&#x2015;is losing its moral and aesthetic impact.</p><p>A thorough examination of the manner in which three of the most unsettling modern writers&#x2015;Aragon, Sartre, and Barthes&#x2015;affirm their personal rebellion followed by Kristeva's own ideas on the future of rebellion.Julia Kristeva is a practicing psychoanalyst and professor of linguistics at the University of Paris.

It also labeled John F. Kennedy a traitor and actively worked to unseat him. The Birch Society boasted a number of notable members, including Fred Koch, father of Charles and David Koch, who are using their father&#x2019;s billions to bankroll fundamentalist and&nbsp;right-wing movements today. <br><br> The daughter of one of the society&#x2019;s first members and a national spokesman about the society, Claire Conner grew up surrounded by dedicated Birchers and was expected to abide by and espouse Birch ideals. When her parents forced her to join the society at age thirteen, she became its youngest member of the society. From an even younger age though, Conner was pressed into service for the cause her father and mother gave their lives to: the nurturing and growth of the JBS. She was expected to bring home her textbooks for close examination (her mother found traces of Communist influence even in the Catholic school curriculum), to write letters against &#x201c;socialized medicine&#x201d; after school, to attend her father&#x2019;s fiery speeches against the United Nations, or babysit her siblings while her parents held meetings in the living room to recruit members to fight the war on Christmas or (potentially poisonous) water fluoridation. Conner was &#x201c;on deck&#x201d; to lend a hand when JBS notables visited, including founder Robert Welch, notorious Holocaust denier Revilo Oliver, and white supremacist Thomas Stockheimer. Even when she was old enough to quit in disgust over the actions of those men, Conner found herself sucked into campaigns against abortion rights and for ultraconservative presidential candidates like John Schmitz. It took momentous changes in her own life for Conner to finally free herself of the legacy of the John Birch Society in which she was raised. <br><br> In <i>Wrapped in the Flag</i>, Claire Conner offers an intimate account of the society &#x2014;based on JBS records and documents, on her parents&#x2019; files and personal writing, on historical archives and contemporary accounts, and on firsthand knowledge&#x2014;giving us an inside look at one of the most radical right-wing movements in US history and its lasting effects on our political discourse today.</p><p><b>Claire Conner&#x2019;s</b> father was a national spokesperson for the John Birch Society for more than thirty years; her mother was also a staunch follower. Conner holds a degree in English with honors from the University of Dallas and a graduate degree from the University of Wisconsin. She lives in Tampa, Florida.<i>Preface<br></i>I Know What Exremism Looks Like<br><br>Five years ago, I was sure I&#x2019;d heard the last of conspiracies, secret Communists, and America&#x2019;s imminent collapse. After all, the Cold War had been over for twenty years, my parents and most of their fanatic friends were dead, and the Bush administration was killing America&#x2019;s appetite for right-wing Republicans.<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no one left to hoist the extremist flag,&#x201d; I told myself. I was wrong. By 2008, political discourse sounded eerily similar to that of 1958, when a brand-new right-wing, populist movement&#x2014;the John Birch Society&#x2014;burst onto the American scene. All across the country, newly awakened Birchers rallied to &#x201c;take our county back.&#x201d; Two dedicated Birch leaders mobilized the Midwest: Stillwell and Laurene Conner&#x2014;my parents.<br> Dad and Mother had been primed for their lurch to the right for many years. They loved Joseph McCarthy and hated the Communists. They&#x2019;d decided that government assistance made people weak and lazy, and that the New Deal was really a bad deal. They loathed Franklin Roosevelt and blamed Democrats for destroying our free-enterprise system. So in 1955, when Mother and Dad were introduced to Robert Welch, a candy-company executive turned conspiracy hunter, they immediately recognized a kindred soul. My father said Welch was &#x201c;a brilliant mind and the finest patriot I&#x2019;ve ever had the privilege to know.&#x201d; Three years later, when Welch founded his John Birch Society, Mother and Dad didn&#x2019;t hesitate&#x2014; they signed up and immediately handed over $2,000 for lifetime memberships, the equivalent of about $15,000 today. <br> The John Birch Society became my parents&#x2019; lifelong obsession; nothing was allowed to interfere with the next meeting, the next project, the next mailing. At fourteen and thirteen, respectively, my older brother and I were deemed old enough to take up the cause as full-fledged adult members. During Birch activities, the other Conner children were banished upstairs, where my ten-year-old sister was put in charge of the baby (eighteen months) and my six-year-old brother fended for himself. In only a few months, the entire Conner family lived and breathed Birch.<br> Night after night, Birch activists and new recruits filled our living room.<br> They received hours of instruction about the secret conspiracy, the New World Order, hidden codes on the dollar bill, and Communist spies inside our government. Birchers were schooled in the evils of creeping socialism, Communism, and Marxism. Good Birchers understood the sins of welfare and Social Security. It was time to rise up against the unholy alliance of the Left&#x2014;Communists, socialists, liberals, union bosses, and the liberal press. Robert Welch identified Communists as one enemy in this epic struggle to save the country. Of course, in the 1950s the march of the Communists across Eastern Europe and Asia was scary to Americans, but Welch was more worried about the Communists lurking inside our country, often holding positions of influence. These home-grown American Communists were ready to spring into action to take down our Constitution and replace it with a socialist manifesto.<br> Birchers believed that those American Communists were all over the place. They served on school boards, advocated putting fluoride in drinking water, and taught subversive university classes. Others organized labor unions, led the civil rights movement and served in the Congress. The Birch message resonated. Membership exploded and revenue spiked. My father was rewarded for his dedication with a promotion to the Birch National Council, where he served for thirty-two years.<br> -<br> From the outset, the GOP applauded the Birchers for their patriotic zeal and embraced them as good Republicans. But after a scandal rocked the society in 1961, the GOP worried that its closeness to the Birchers would taint the Republican brand. It could not afford to be painted by the Democrats as the political arm of the radical right. Republican leaders decided to label the Birchers as crackpots and push them out of the party. Problem solved. The effort worked. Before long, the Birchers had joined the Ku Klux Klan, Aryan Nations, and other kooks as the most extreme reactionaries in American politics. The Republican Party took credit for saving the United States from fringe-of-the-fringe crusaders who imagined that even the president was a Commie. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, while the politicians and pundits declared the Birchers dead and buried, the moneyed Birch leadership went to plan B, redirecting their cash and their influence into think tanks and foundations. My parents joined in that diversifying effort. They founded a right-wing Catholic organization, the Wanderer Foundation, in St. Paul, Minnesota and donated to every right-wing organization and political-action committee they could. My parents never had big money, but other Birch families spent huge sums to bankroll Birch ideas. Fred Koch, one of the original Birch founding members and a National Council member with my father, invested a small fortune on his pet projects, including the so-called right-to-work laws, designed to hamper union organizing. His sons, David and Charles Koch, inherited their father&#x2019;s multimillions, turned them into multibillions, and invested liberally in their favorite political causes: the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, Americans for Prosperity, and others. Those organizations incorporated many John Birch Society ideas and effectively increased both their reach and their impact on American politics. Since <i>Citizens United</i>, the 2011 Supreme Court decision that opened the floodgates to unlimited and unregulated corporate political donations, the Kochs have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to individual candidates and political-action committees. The Kochs and their allies envision the same framework for American government that I heard from my father and his John Birch Society allies: the New Deal dismantled, the federal government reduced to a quarter of its current size, and most federal programs gutted. In this right-wing, libertarian utopia, businesses and individuals would be free to do anything, unrestrained by rules or taxes. In 2008, when the economy tanked and Barack Obama emerged as the Democratic nominee for president, the radical right went on the offense. The Democrat was labeled a Marxist, a Socialist, and a friend of terrorists. Folks unfurled the yellow &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Tread on Me&#x201d; flag and shouted about trees of liberty being watered with the blood of tyrants. When I heard frenzied voters at a Republican rally shouting, &#x201c;Treason,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Kill him,&#x201d; in response to one of Sarah Palin&#x2019;s anti-Obama rants, I worried. &#x201c;My parents are back,&#x201d; I told anyone who&#x2019;d listen. People looked at me like I&#x2019;d lost my mind. I realized that the Birch Society had faded out of America&#x2019;s memory. It had been confined to a footnote on<br> a footnote for political wonks. Six months after President Obama was inaugurated, a new right-wing, populist movement arose. The Tea Party&#x2014;bankrolled by the Koch brothers and Americans for Prosperity&#x2014;staged rallies and protests across the country. Self-appointed zealots suggested &#x201c;Second Amendment remedies&#x201d; if they didn&#x2019;t achieve their goals at the ballot box. I shuddered when I heard my father&#x2019;s favorite rally cry: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve come to take our country back.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> These newly minted right-wingers were rattling off old Birch slogans:<br> � Immigrants are the enemy. Protect our borders and deport all illegal aliens.<br> � Gays are ungodly. Pray the gay away from children and teens.<br> � Unemployed people don&#x2019;t want to work, and poor people keep themselves poor, on purpose. If we cut the minimum wage and eliminate unemployment compensation, everyone will have a job.<br> � Unions caused the economic collapse by shielding lazy, incompetent public employees.<br> � Rich folks are &#x201c;job creators,&#x201d; and we need to protect their wealth.<br> � Social Security is unsustainable, and Medicare and Medicaid have to be restricted so that corporations and &#x201c;job creators&#x201d; have lower tax rates.<br> � Abortion is murder and must be outlawed even in cases of rape and incest. No exception means no exceptions; even in cases where the mother&#x2019;s life is in danger.<br> � The economic meltdown of 2008 came from high taxes on corporations, too many regulations, and poor people taking out mortgages they couldn&#x2019;t afford.<br> � The government can&#x2019;t create jobs, so stimulus programs don&#x2019;t work. Cutting taxes creates jobs.<br> � The government can&#x2019;t limit the right to own or carry guns. If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.<br> � America is God&#x2019;s chosen nation, but our president can&#x2019;t understand our exceptionalism. After all, he&#x2019;s not a &#x201c;real&#x201d; American; he&#x2019;s a Marxist, Socialist, Muslim racist who hates America.<br> &nbsp;<br> I know that this new radical Right is a rewrite of the old John Birch Society. This time, however, the movement has enormous political muscle, unlimited dollars, and right-wing media support. This reality hit me after studying my parents&#x2019; files and personal writing, combing historical archives, and reading contemporary accounts and documents produced by the Birch Society itself.<br> My notes credit published works and archival documents, but much of this narrative comes from my experience. This book chronicles the history of the John Birch Society and its impact on America, past and present. But above all, <i>Wrapped in the Flag </i>is my story.</p><h2>Why Can&#39;t We Be Good?</h2><p><b>The widely respected social philosopher embarks on his most gripping and broadly appealing work, asking the ultimate question of human nature: Why do we repeatedly violate our most deeply held values and beliefs?</b> <br><br> After nearly forty years of weighing humanity's deepest dilemmas-working in settings ranging from university and high school classrooms to corporate offices and hospitals-bestselling author, philosopher, and religious scholar Jacob Needleman presents the most urgent, deeply felt, and widely accessible work of his career. <br><br> In <i>Why Can't We Be Good?</i> Needleman identifies the core problem that therapists and social philosophers fail to see. He depicts the individual human as a being who knows what is good, yet who remains mysteriously helpless to innerly adopt the ethical, moral, and religious ideas that are bequeathed to him.</p><p>The acclaimed author of <i>The American Soul</i>, <i>Why Can&#x2019;t We Be Good?</i> and <i>Money and the Meaning of Life</i>, Jacob Needleman is Professor of Philosophy at San Francisco State University, and former Director of the Center for the Study of New Religions at the Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley. He lives in Oakland, CA.Most people have a intrinsic desire to do good rather than evil, yet all humans fail in perplexing ways to do good. Needleman's titular question has haunted philosophers and religious thinkers since Socrates. Needleman, professor of philosophy at San Francisco State and popular author of <i>Lost Christianity</i>, offers his eloquent and entertaining thoughts about why humans are such flops at goodness. He draws on a wide range of philosophers, religious thinkers and psychologists&#x2014;from Socrates to Buddha to Rabbi Hillel&#x2014;and discovers that our inability to be good is simple: humans are creatures of choice, and our freedom allows us to make bad choices as well as good ones. This freedom, however, is also "the freedom to love and act justly toward man." Using exercises from his own classes, Needleman suggests that the practice of attending to the other&#x2014;listening carefully, repeating what the other person has said to ensure an accurate hearing&#x2014;moves us a long way toward achieving the good. Though Needleman's answer to this age-old question about goodness is no more satisfying or original than any other, his lively prose, storytelling skills and lucid insights draw us into an animated conversation with a brilliant teacher. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina.</p><p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p></p><p>I'd just caught my breath after the shock of my husband's sudden passing when his last legacy showed up on my front porch. We'd buried Wesley Lloyd Springer some few months before that hot, still morning in August, and I hoped I was through signing forms and meeting with lawyers and shuffling through various and sundry legal papers. I declare, this business of dying has more legal aspects to it than you would think. The deceased never knows what you have to go through to get his affairs in order, and Wesley Lloyd's were in as much order as they could get. I thought.</p><p>Lord, it was hot that morning, and I recalled again how Wesley Lloyd had always put his foot down about air-conditioning the house, even when the Conovers had theirs done. Central air, too. Wesley Lloyd said it was a waste of money and, besides, fresh air was good for us. He felt that way only at home, though, because his office at the bank was kept cool enough for the threepiece suits he wore day in and day out. But I don't believe in speaking ill of the dead, even when it's the truth.</p><p>So I was sitting in my living room trying to get my mind off the heat by looking through a stack of mail-order catalogs. Making a list of the items I intended to call in for and having a good time doing it, since Binkie Enloe'd said I needed to spend some, money. Sam Murdoch had agreed, and he ought've known since he was the executor of the will that had put me in my present more-than-comfortable position. Lord, there was more money than I ever knew Wesley Lloyd had, and it all belonged to me, his grieving widow. But a proud widow, too, and justly so, because I'd made such a fine and fortunate choice of husbands.</p><p>But I tell you, I thought I'd never get over the shock of finding Wesley Lloyd dead as a doornail, slumped over the steering wheel of his new Buick Park Avenue. Steel gray with plush upholstery, parked right out there in the driveway.</p><p>But I did, laying him to rest in a properly ordered Presbyterian ceremony as he would've expected. Then I had to suffer another shock when I found out how well-off Wesley Lloyd had been. Why, besides the bank his daddy'd left him, he owned half the county, seemed like, plus stocks and bonds and tax-deferred annuities, all of it making more and more money every day of the week. When the extent of his estate was laid out for me, all I could think of was how he used to hand me a housekeeping allowance every Friday, saying, "Make it last, Julia. Money doesn't grow on trees, you know." And all the time he was cultivating a whole grove! Well, a lot of good it did him, because I ended up with every penny.</p><p>Now, after forty-four years in blissful ignorance of Wesley Lloyd's activities, financial and otherwise, I had settled down to enjoy the benefits of widowhood and a full checkbook, both of which I was mastering with hardly any problems to speak of.</p><p>I looked out the window as a few cars passed by on Polk Street, headed down to Main. I declare, everybody and his brother seemed to have a telephone glued to his ear, though this town's not big enough to need BellSouth whenever you drive to the grocery store. Across the street the parking lot spread from Polk to the back of the First Presbyterian Church of Abbotsville, my church and the one Wesley Lloyd and his father, before him, had supported with their presence, tithes, offerings, and over-and-above donations. Advice, too, which was always taken but not always appreciated. Heat waves shimmered up from the asphalt lot as I took note of whose cars were parked over there. It was my custom to keep up with what went on around me and, since Mondays were Pastor Ledbetter's days off, I couldn't be blamed for wondering why he was meeting with several men on the session at the church. But far be it from me to be nosy.</p><p>I could hear Lillian humming along with the radio above the occasional clatter of pans out in the kitchen as she prepared my lunch. That was another thing that was different, now that Wesley Lloyd wouldn't be home for meals anymore. He'd liked a quiet house, meals served on time, and everything done right on schedule. I had already begun to enjoy a little freedom from that schedule, telling Lillian that we'd eat whenever either of us got hungry or she got the urge to put something on the table.</p><p>I licked a finger and turned a page in the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog, wondering what Sam and Binkie would say if I ordered a few trinkets from it. I declare, some of the offerings were for people with more money than sense, a condition that didn't apply to me, I'm happy to say. I expect, though, that any number of people would've said it did if they'd known the full extent of Wesley Lloyd's prudence and foresight.</p><p>However. His prudence and foresight hadn't taken heart attacks into account. I knew as sure as I was sitting there he never intended to leave me in charge of everything he owned. I knew it as soon as Pastor Ledbetter came sidling up to me not two days after laying Wesley Lloyd to rest, telling me he knew I'd want to 'honor Mr. Springer's last wishes even if they'd never gotten written down. That was the first I'd heard that Wesley Lloyd had planned to make the First Presbyterian Church. . .</p></p><h2>I Still Believe</h2><p>Christian recording artist Jeremy Camp has written songs that have touched millions of lives.

Unfortunately, very little scientific work has been clone on the question. The major stumbling block has been that psychologists who have worked on the question, like Binet. have not been first-rank chess players and so have not had direct access to the mental processes involved in grandmaster chess. On the other hand, chess players are not usually first-rate psychologists. There is one important exception to this rule-a man who has produced a remarkable book in this area. This is Dr. Reuben Fine, one of the great chess players of this century (he has played on equal terms with Botvinnik, Reshevsky, Smyslov, and others) and a qualified psychoanalyst. Dr. Fine has called upon his own understanding of chess processes and his unrivaled contacts in the chess world in this attempt to analyze both the game of chess itself and its peculiar appeals, particularly to male players as opposed to females, to isolate its inner meaning, and to categorize and understand the special combination of characteristics that make tip a chess champion. Some of the great players studied here, such as Lasker, Capablanca, and Botvinnik, Dr. Fine has known, both in terms of chess and as personalities. He discusses other great players of the past, Staunton, Andersen, Morphy, as their personalities are revealed in books, articles, and legends that have grown up about them. The result is an unexpected synthesis, far from a simplistic answer to the basic question, which describes what these men did and did not have in common. All in all. Dr. Fine&#39;s searching analyses make an absorbing book-brilliantly written, sometimes controversial, always stimulating.</p><p>Reuben Fine (born October 11, 1914 - died March 26, 1993) was one of the strongest chess players in the world from the mid 1930s through the 1940s, an International Grandmaster, psychologist and author of books on both chess and psychology. Fine won five medals (four gold) in three chess Olympiads. Fine won the U.S. Open Chess Championship all seven times he entered (1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1939, 1940, 1941). He was the author of several chess books that are still popular today, including important books on the chess endgame, opening, and middlegame. He earned a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1932. After World War II, he earned his doctorate in psychology, and wrote many successful books in that field as well. Although he was regarded as a serious contender for the World Chess Championship, he declined his invitation to participate in the six-player 1948 match-tournament to determine the World Champion.<br><br>Reuben Fine (born October 11, 1914 &#x2013; died March 26, 1993) was a chess grandmaster and one of the strongest chess players in the world.

The matter of his death was sudden, violent and unpremiditated, and there were some who argue that he killed himself because he was tormented by guilt - guilt that he had survived the horrors of Auschwitz while others, better than he, had gone to the wall. THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED is Levi&#39;s impassioned attempt to understand the &#39;rationale&#39; behind the concentration camps, was completed shortly before his tragic death in 1987. THE DROWNED AND THE SAVED dispels the myth that Primo Levi forgave the Germans for what they did to his people. He didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t forgive. He refused, however, to indulge in what he called &#39;the bestial vice of hatred&#39; which is an entirely different matter. The voice that sounds in his writing is that of a reasonable man...it warns and reminds us that the unimaginable can happen again. A would-be tyrant is waiting in the wings, with &#39;beautiful words&#39; on his lips. The book is constantly impressing on us the need to learn from the past, to make sense of the senseless&#39; PAUL BAILEY</p><p>This book, published months after Italian writer Primo Levi's suicide in 1987, is a small but powerful look at Auschwitz, the hell where Levi was imprisoned during World War II. The book was his third on the subject, following <i>Survival in Auschwitz</i> (1947) and <i>The Reawakening</i> (1963). Removed from the experience by time and age, Levi chose to serve more as an observer of the camp than the passionate young man of his previous work. He writes of "useless violence" inflicted by the guards on prisoners and then concludes the book with a discussion of the Germans who have written to him about their complicity in the event. In all, he tries to make sense of something that--as he knew--made no sense at all.Levi wrote of the moral collapse that occurred in Auschwitz and the fallibility of human memory that allows such atrocities to recur.

Desperate to right old wrongs, a new client hires Russell Quant to locate her son, Matthew, lost to her for twenty years. But can money relieve remorse? Through good old-fashioned detective work, Russell peels away the layers of a carefully concealed life, grown from the seeds of traumatic childhood violence. Tracking Matthew's life from the schoolyard drug culture of a pleasant prairie city's underbelly to the stunning vistas, vibrant townships, and tinderbox safaris of Africa, Russell finds much more than he was looking for. Ever adept at making both friends and foes, Quant runs a gauntlet of uncharted danger as worlds collide. Thrust into the unfamiliar role of bad guy, stymied by seemingly insurmountable distrust and base fear, Russell cuts a blistering swath through covert threats and overt bullets. But as he searches for his Canadian needle in an African haystack, the brutality escalates. Confronting his own role in the cause and effect of scars and anger, retribution and revenge, Russell Quant faces a difficult question: What happens when the prodigal son resists the return?

A wanted man in England, he is driven to fight as a mercenary archer in France, where he finds two things he can love: his instincts as a fighting man, and a girl in trouble. Together they survive the notorious massacre at Soissons, an event that shocks all Christendom. With no options left, Hook heads home to England, where his capture means certain death. Instead he is discovered by the young King of England--Henry V himself--and by royal command he takes up the longbow again and dons the cross of Saint George. Hook returns to France as part of the superb army Henry leads in his quest to claim the French crown. But after the English campaign suffers devastating early losses, it becomes clear that Hook and his fellow archers are their king's last resort in a desperate fight against an enemy more daunting than they could ever have imagined. </p> <p> One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare in <i>Henry V</i>--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands. Here Bernard Cornwell resurrects the legend of the battle and the "band of brothers" who fought it on October 25, 1415. An epic of redemption, <i>Agincourt</i> follows a commoner, a king, and a nation's entire army on an improbable mission to test the will of God and reclaim what is rightfully theirs. From the disasters at the siege of Harfleur to the horrors of the field of Agincourt, this exhilarating story of survival and slaughter is at once a brilliant work of history and a triumph of imagination&#x2014;Bernard Cornwell at his best. </p> <p> <strong> Historical Notes on <i>Agincourt</i> by Bernard Cornwell</strong> </p> <p> </p><p>The battle of Agincourt (Azincourt was and remains the French spelling) was one of the most remarkable events of medieval Europe, a battle whose reputation far outranked its importance. In the long history of Anglo-French rivalry only Hastings, Waterloo, Trafalgar, and Cr�cy share Agincourt&#x2019;s renown. It is arguable that Poitiers was a more significant battle and an even more complete victory, or that Verneuil was just as astonishing a triumph, and it&#x2019;s certain that Hastings, Blenheim, Victoria, Trafalgar, and Waterloo were more influential on the course of history, yet Agincourt still holds its extraordinary place in English legend. Something quite remarkable happened on 25 October 1415 (Agincourt was fought long before Christendom&#x2019;s conversion to the new-style calendar, so the modern anniversary should be on 4 November). It was something so remarkable that its fame persists almost six hundred years later.</p> <p>Agincourt&#x2019;s fame could just be an accident, a quirk of history reinforced by Shakespeare&#x2019;s genius, but the evidence suggests it really was a battle that sent a shock wave through Europe. For years afterward the French called 25 October 1415 <i>la malheureuse journ�e</i> (the unfortunate day). Even after they had expelled the English from France they remembered la malheureuse journ�e with sadness. It had been a disaster.</p> <p>Yet it was so nearly a disaster for Henry V and his small, but well-equipped army. That army had sailed from Southampton Water with high hopes, the chief of which was the swift capture of Harfleur, which would be followed by a foray into the French heartland in hope, presumably, of bringing the French to battle. A victory in that battle would demonstrate, at least in the pious Henry&#x2019;s mind, God&#x2019;s support of his claim to the French throne, and might even propel him onto that throne. Such hopes were not vain when his army was intact, but the siege of Harfleur took much longer than expected and Henry&#x2019;s army was almost ruined by dysentery.</p> <p>The tale of the siege in the novel is, by and large, accurate, though I did take one great liberty, which was to sink a mineshaft opposite the Leure Gate. There was no such shaft, the ground would not allow it, and all the real mines were dug by the Duke of Clarence&#x2019;s forces that were assailing the eastern side of Harfleur. The French counter-mines defeated those diggings, but I wanted to give a flavor, however inadequately, of the horrors men faced in fighting beneath the earth. The defense of Harfleur was magnificent, for which much of the praise must go to Raoul de Gaucourt, one of the garrison&#x2019;s leaders. His defiance, and the long days of the siege, gave the French a chance to raise a much larger army than any they might have fielded against Henry if the siege had ended, say, in early September.</p> <p><b>Maps of the Battlefield (Click to Enlarge)</b></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td></tr> <tr> <td>England and France, 1415:<br>One of the most dramatic victories in British history, the battle of Agincourt--immortalized by Shakespeare in <i>Henry V</i>--pitted undermanned and overwhelmed English forces against a French army determined to keep their crown out of Henry's hands.</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>The French Coast:<br>The British campaign, which started at Harfleur, ended more than two months later on 25 October at Agincourt.</td> <td>Harfleur:<br>Henry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415 and besieged the port of Harfleur.</td> <td>The Battle Lines:<br>&#x201c;We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.&#x201d; &#x2013; William Shakespeare, <i>Henry V</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p></p><p></p>A brutal and visceral tour through the medieval world, where life is balanced on the point of an arrow, and where war is fought with every bit of sinew in one's body. . . .

The introduction defines the place of this novel in Smollett's whole career. Also Beasley develops arguments that <i>Fathom</i> was a notable experiment in fiction, 'a serious and unblushing representation of remorseless (at least until the end) villainy,' and that the work represents an attempt to discover a way of presenting the relation between fiction and real life. Beasley's notes, more comprehensive than any ever offered before, are especially illuminating as identifications of literary allusions and historical references.

To his surprise, robots are everywhere. From paint-bots to crane-bots, each quietly does its job. But when Wall-e spots Eve, a boisterous chase begins, and suddenly everything goes haywire. This spirited take on the film <i>Wall-e</i> features lively verse and a fresh visual approach from a Pixar artist.</p><p>PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2014;Pixar's film <i>WALL*E</i> inspired this rhymed tour of robots at work.

Haig-Brown is one of the world&#39;s most beloved fly-fishing writers. Here, for the first time in a single paperback volume, are his popular seasons books: Fisherman&#39;s Spring, Fisherman&#39;s Summer, Fisherman&#39;s Fall, and Fisherman&#39;s Winter. They chronicle a fisherman&#39;s year, from the brightening days of spring through a loving portrait of the author&#39;s home rivers in British Columbia during the summer, and on into the excitement of fall fishing and a winter away to fish the great rivers of Argentina and Chile.</p><p>Logger, trapper, guide, magistrate, army officer, radio broadcaster, conservationist, and university chancellor, Roderick L. Haig-Brown, the multitalented Renaissance man of North American angling, considered himself first and foremost a writer. Given the overall quality, range, depth, and grace of <i>The Seasons of a Fisherman</i>, it would be awfully hard to argue. This marvelous volume, which collects four of his best-loved classics between one set of covers for the first time, should elegantly introduce Haig-Brown, who died in 1976, to a new generation of outdoors enthusiasts as it reintroduces him to his old angling friends. <p> Originally written in the early '50s, the four books wade into an angler's summer, winter, spring, and fall, and while each muses over what a particular season requires of the fisherman, none is just about fishing; Haig-Brown never limited himself. These books are about his beloved British Columbia, the environment as a whole, its repetitive rhythms, and the angler's place in it. They are about fishing stories; the traditions of fly-fishing; and how to catch fish, tie flies, and observe the natural world. Fishing, in Haig-Brown's cosmos, was more than just the pursuit of fish: it was the full, wide-ranging engagement of the mind and the senses.</p> <p> Listen to the litheness of his prose from "Fisherman's Spring," the first of the four sections, as he ponders the worthiness of the endeavor: </p> <blockquote> It is ... something more than a sport. It is an intimate exploration of a part of the world hidden from the eyes and minds of ordinary people. It is a way of thinking and doing, a way of reviving the mind and body, that men have been following with growing intensity for hundreds of years. </blockquote> This is just a taste of what "Seasons" overflows with, as is this admission--is there an angler who can't share it?--from "Summer": "I am beginning to find it very salutary to remember just how much 'happening right,' if not downright luck, there has been in nearly all my little triumphs." As a book, <i>Seasons</i> is a big enough triumph to become a dog-eared cornerstone of your fly-fishing library. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>Roderick L. Haig-Brown was born in England but lived all his adult life on Vancouver Island, along the banks of the Campbell River. His books include A River Never Sleeps, To Know a River, Measure of the Year, and a dozen other important books that together form the finest achievement in angling prose in North America.

Quinn, Mary Ellen</p><h2>When the World Calls: The Inside Story of the Peace Corps and Its First Fifty Years</h2><p><i>When the World Calls</i> is the first complete and balanced look at the Peace Corps&#x2019;s first fifty years. Revelatory and candid, journalist Stanley Meisler&#x2019;s engaging narrative exposes Washington infighting, presidential influence, and the Volunteers&#x2019; unique struggles abroad. He deftly unpacks the complicated history with sharp analysis and memorable anecdotes, taking readers on a global trek starting with the historic first contingent of Volunteers to Ghana on August 30, 1961. In the years since, in spite of setbacks, the ethos of the Peace Corps has endured, largely due to the perseverance of the 200,000 Volunteers themselves, whose shared commitment to effect positive global change has been a constant in one of our most complex&#x2014;and valued&#x2014;institutions.</p><p><p><b>Stanley Meisler</b>, the author of two other books, was a foreign and diplomatic correspondent for the<i> Los Angeles Times</i> for three decades. He was also deputy director of the Peace Corps&#x2019;s Office of Evaluation and Research in the mid-1960s. Meisler, who lives in Washington, D.C., has written for <i>Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy,</i> the<i> Atlantic,</i> the<i> Nation, </i>and <i>Smithsonian, </i>and periodically posts news commentaries on his Web site.</p><b>From Chapter Eight, &#x201c;The Specter of Vietnam&#x201d;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> On January 6, 1966, two Peace Corps officials embarked on a secret, reckless trip to Vietnam. The goal of their mission was to find out whether Vietnam might be a suitable country for a Peace Corps program. That goal was foolish and fanciful. President Lyndon Johnson had already dispatched thousands of combat troops to South Vietnam and ordered the continual bombing of North Vietnam. Antiwar rallies were already dominating campus life on universities throughout the United States. Peace Corps Volunteers were joining protests. Any attempt to place Volunteers in Vietnam would have crippled the Peace Corps. Even news of the exploratory trip would have damaged the Peace Corps badly.<br> &nbsp;<br> The two officials were Warren Wiggins, deputy director of the Peace Corps, and Ross J. Pritchard, director of Far East regional operations. Within the Peace Corps, Wiggins and Pritchard were known as the most fervent players of the numbers game&#x2014;they relentlessly promoted massive new programs without worrying about meticulous planning. But it was not their idea to go to Vietnam.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wiggins, who died in 2007, never discussed the Vietnam adventure publicly. But Pritchard, retired in Tennessee, says they flew to Vietnam because Johnson ordered them to go. Pritchard says he and Wiggins knew that a program in Vietnam &#x201c;would ruin the Peace Corps, absolutely wreck it. Because of the mood on campuses, it would cut us off at the knees.&#x201d; But Bill Moyers, the former Peace Corps deputy director who was now White House press secretary, told them that Johnson insisted they go. According to Pritchard, &#x201c;We went with great, great reluctance.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They should have resisted. But Johnson&#x2019;s insistence came at a time would not take over the agency until March 1.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite their reluctance, Wiggins and Pritchard sent a rather enthusiastic cable to the U.S. embassy in Saigon announcing their arrival. The cable, written by Pritchard, boasted, &#x201c;Peace Corps elsewhere and its ability to provide significant numbers of Volunteers suggests there may be a useful role in Vietnam.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;While it is important for the Peace Corps to maintain an independent, nonpolitical stance in order to avoid jeopardizing its worldwide acceptance,&#x201d; the cable went on, &#x201c;the ability of the Peace Corps to work with and attract host country participation may have potential in Vietnam now and more especially in the future.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The two officials provided a cover story and assured their hosts that the Peace Corps was prepared to lie about the mission. &#x201c;We desire to avoid publicity for this visit,&#x201d; they said. &#x201c;If questioned here [Washington], the Peace Corps will take the position that both men are in vicinity Southeast Asia on business and interested in exploring possible role for Peace Corps Volunteers and/or other international Volunteers with refugee work in Vietnam.&#x201d; There was no need to invoke the cover story. The press never spotted the adventure. In fact, hardly anyone in the Peace Corps itself knew that Wiggins and Pritchard had left for Vietnam.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Saigon, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. welcomed them and promised that the U.S. embassy would show them whatever they wanted to see. Wiggins and Pritchard looked at six sites, including the battleground city of Hue. In each case, their plane would spiral downward while landing to avoid gunfire.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wiggins and Pritchard decided to explore neighboring Laos as well. Their reception from Ambassador William H. Sullivan in Vientiane was far different. Sullivan was supervising what would become known as the &#x201c;secret war&#x201d; in Laos. CIA agents were leading guerilla units against rebels and North Vietnamese troops. U.S. military pilots, wearing civilian clothes, were flying missions in support of the Laotian government.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sullivan did not want independent-minded Peace Corps Volunteers stepping into the cauldron.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sullivan was absolutely adamant that this was the stupidest idea he had ever heard of,&#x201d; Pritchard recalls. &#x201c;He chewed our asses out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> After their ten-day trip, Wiggins and Pritchard wrote a report. They could not resist sounding expansive about the future. &#x201c;Under different circumstances, you could put a thousand Volunteers into Vietnam,&#x201d; they wrote, according to Pritchard. But in view of the dangers of the war and the backlash that a Vietnam program would unleash elsewhere in the Peace Corps, they strongly recommended against launching a program there.<br> &nbsp;<br> The conclusions of the report did not matter in any case. Vaughn, the new director, made it clear: No Volunteers would go to Vietnam, no matter what the report recommended, no matter what Johnson demanded.<br> &nbsp;<br> At Vaughn&#x2019;s swearing-in ceremony at the White House, President Johnson made his case for the Peace Corps in Vietnam someday. While soldiers struggled to halt aggression by North Vietnam and Viet Cong insurgents and provide security in South Vietnam, he said, &#x201c;other workers of peace . . . must lay the foundation for economic and social progress.&#x201d; He counted on the Peace Corps to do just that in the future. &#x201c;The day, I hope, will soon come,&#x201d; the president said, &#x201c;when the Peace Corps will be there, too. It must somehow find the day and the time that it can go and make its contribution when peace is assured.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In at least four meetings during the next three years, Johnson pressured Vaughn to send Volunteers to Vietnam. Johnson promised they would work only in the &#x201c;pacified&#x201d; areas. The president said he would be satisfied even with a program of only ten to fifteen Volunteers. But Vaughn turned him down each time.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet even as it kept out of Vietnam, the Peace Corps could not escape the war. Gerald Berreman, an anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley, warned students in 1965, &#x201c;The government wants the Peace Corps to be a playpen for activist students to keep them out of the kitchen while the adults are cooking up the war in Vietnam.&#x201d; He urged them to stay out of the Peace Corps and protest the war instead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some idealistic Volunteers hoped that the leaders of the Peace Corps would stand up to such criticism by forthrightly defying President Johnson and denouncing the war themselves. Marlyn Dalsimer, a former Volunteer in the Ivory Coast, wrote a letter to Jack Vaughn. The letter, Dalsimer recalled later, told Vaughn that &#x201c;I had observed his never having made a public statement about the war in Vietnam. I told him that as head of an organization with &#x2018;peace&#x2019; in its name, I expected him to. We always hoped the Peace Corps would be different.&#x201d; The Peace Corps <i>was </i>different, but not so different that its director could oppose the president openly and keep his job.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1965, an article opposing the war appeared in a Volunteer newspaper in Malawi. The article was written by Paul Theroux, a Volunteer teacher who would become one of the most distinguished American novelists of the next half-century. The article infuriated U.S. Ambassador Sam P. Gilstrap. He ordered the expulsion of the Peace Corps director, Michael McCone, for allowing the newspaper to publish a diatribe against U.S. policy. (Theroux, chastened but not otherwise punished, was later thrown out by the Malawi government for delivering letters for friends who were opponents of the dictator Hastings Kuzuma Banda.)<br> &nbsp;<br> As the war intensified and the awful casualties mounted, Vaughn was forced to field protests from every side of the Peace Corps&#x2014;even from his own staff. Kirby Jones, the Volunteer who helped write the letter of protest to Lyndon Johnson about the Dominican invasion, worked for the Peace Corps in 1967 as the Ecuadorean desk officer. Allard Lowenstein, the militant anti&#x2013;Vietnam War protester and future congressman, persuaded Jones to join him in drafting a protest letter to President Johnson. Jones then started collecting signatures from returned Peace Corps Volunteers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Vaughn asked him to stop, but Jones refused. &#x201c;Then he [Vaughn] went through this long song and dance,&#x201d; Jones recalled, &#x201c;about how long it had taken him to establish credibility in the White House, since Johnson had always thought of the Peace Corps as a Kennedy creation, full of Kennedyites, and that this was going to adversely affect the relationship between the Peace Corps and the White House.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have to fire me, because I&#x2019;m not going to stop,&#x201d; Jones said<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to fire you,&#x201d; said Vaughn.<br> &nbsp;<br> The most publicized protest case involved a Volunteer who taught music at the University of Concepcion, in Chile. Bruce Murray and more than ninety fellow Volunteers signed a letter in 1967 protesting the bombing of North Vietnam and calling for negotiations to end the war. The Volunteers planned to pay for the publication of the letter as an advertisement in the <i>New York Times</i>. But after local Peace Corps officials discovered what was going on, Ambassador Ralph Dungan warned the Volunteers they could be thrown out of the Peace Corps if the letter were published. A similar warning came from Vaughn.<br> &nbsp;<br> Faced with these threats, the Volunteers abandoned their project. But Murray was angered by Vaughn&#x2019;s restrictions on the rights of the Volunteers to speak out on American issues. In a letter to Vaughn, Murray accepted the stricture that Volunteers &#x201c;should not meddle in the politics of the host country.&#x201d; But he argued that this restriction should not prevent Volunteers from speaking out on &#x201c;international policies of the United States which may be of interest to the host country.&#x201d; He sent a copy of this letter to the <i>New York Times</i>, but the newspaper did not publish it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The news agency United Press International (UPI) found out about the controversy and released an article describing the suppression of Volunteer antiwar protests by the Peace Corps. The article was published in the newspaper <i>El Sur </i>of Concepcion. Murray felt that the UPI article did not state the position of the Volunteers fully, and he sent <i>El Sur </i>a Spanish translation of his letter to Vaughn. The Chilean newspaper published it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Peace Corps retribution was swift. Country director Paul Bell ordered Murray home, ostensibly for &#x201c;consultations.&#x201d; When Murray arrived in Washington, he found that no consultations were scheduled. He had already been dismissed from the Peace Corps.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was very distraught,&#x201d; Murray recalled later. &#x201c;I really loved Chile and wanted to stay another year . . . . People at the university were upset, too, because my dismissal was a contradiction of everything the Peace Corps had been saying&#x2014;that we were independent agents and not called upon to toe the government line. I had voiced a protest and was gone&#x2014;in the middle of a semester.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The American Civil Liberties Union took up the case, and Murray filed suit against the Peace Corps for wrongful dismissal. Federal Judge Raymond Pettine in Providence heard the case and ruled against the Peace Corps. While the judge understood that the Peace Corps had &#x201c;an interest in remaining apolitical with respect to host country politics,&#x201d; he called the dismissal &#x201c;a shocking, unconstitutional act on the part of the Peace Corps.&#x201d; The government, in the judge&#x2019;s view, could prove no national interest in preventing Murray from speaking out &#x201c;about matters of vital interest to him as a human being, a United States citizen, and a Peace Corps Volunteer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the wake of the Murray controversy, Vaughn retreated. He set down regulations, revised them, and, in any case, no longer disciplined anyone. As the war ground on, killing many young Americans and many more Vietnamese, the pressure on Volunteers to cry out intensified. Vaughn decided to trust in the good sense of the Volunteers.<br> &nbsp;<br> A formula of sorts evolved. The Peace Corps administration agreed that the Volunteers, unlike members of the armed forces, had the right to speak out and protest U.S. policy if they saw fit. In turn, the Peace Corps wanted the Volunteers to accept two limitations on their freedom of speech: They must not interfere in the internal politics of the host country, and their actions must not harm the Peace Corps.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the formula was fragile, dependent on interpretation. When Murray was dismissed, a spokesman for the Peace Corps had said, &#x201c;The Vietnam War is a major issue in Chile, and it has been the policy of the Peace Corps not to get involved in any local political issue.&#x201d; This, of course, was a good deal of a stretch&#x2014;it would be difficult to find any controversial U.S. foreign policy that was not a political issue in most other countries.</p><h2>A Way of Escape</h2><p><p>For people trapped by unwanted thoughts, compulsive habits, or painful pasts, Anderson provides steps to overcome sexual strongholds.

She lives in Surrey with her husband and two children.Chapter One<br><br> On 20 May 1303, a solemn betrothal took place in Paris. The bride was seven years old, the groom, who was not present, nineteen. She was Isabella, the daughter of Philip IV, King of France; he, Edward of Caernarvon, Prince of Wales, the son and heir of Edward I, King of England.<br><br> The Prince had sent the Earl of Lincoln and the Count of Savoy as his proxies, and during the ceremony, they formally asked the King and Queen of France for the hand of their daughter, the Lady Isabella, in marriage for the Prince of Wales. Consent was duly given, then Gilles, Archbishop of Narbonne, the presiding priest, required Isabella to plight her troth. Placing her hand in that of the Archbishop, she duly did so, giving her assent to the betrothal on condition that all the articles of the marriage treaty were fulfilled.<br><br> This union had been arranged after tortuous negotiations to cement a lasting peace between those old warring enemies, England and France. Isabella&#x2019;s father, Philip IV, known as Philip the Fair, was the most powerful ruler in Christendom at that time and also the most controversial. Not only had he been engaged in territorial wars with both England and Flanders for the past seven years, he had also, despite boasting the title of &#x201c;Most Christian King,&#x201d; become involved in a bitter conflict with the Papacy after imposing limitations on the Pope&#x2019;s authority in France. This was to lead to his excommunication only months after his daughter&#x2019;s betrothal.<br><br> Philip&#x2019;s war with Edward I was the result of a long-standing feud over England&#x2019;s possessions in France. In the twelfth century, through the marriage of Henry II to Eleanor of Aquitaine, the empire of the Plantagenets, the dynasty that Henry founded, had extended from Normandy to the Pyrenees, while the royal demesne of France had been limited to the regions around Paris. By 1204, Henry&#x2019;s son, King John, had lost most of the English territories, including Normandy, to the ambitious Philip II &#x201c;Augustus&#x201d; of France, and there were further French encroachments under John&#x2019;s son Henry III, as successive French monarchs sought to broaden their domain. By the time of Edward I, all that remained of England&#x2019;s lands in France was the prosperous wine-producing duchy of Gascony, the southern part of the former duchy of Aquitaine, along with the counties of Ponthieu and Montreuil, which had come to the English Crown through the marriage of Edward I to Eleanor of Castile in 1254.<br><br> Philip IV, who was vigorously carrying on his predecessors&#x2019; expansionist policy, not surprisingly had his eye on Gascony, and in 1296, he invaded and took possession of it. There were two ways to settle a conflict: by military force or by diplomacy. Edward I wanted Gascony back, and Philip wanted to drive a wedge between Edward and the Flemings, who were uniting against him. By 1298, the two Kings were engaged in secret negotiations for a peace. Then Pope Boniface VIII intervened. In the spring of 1298, he suggested a double marriage alliance between France and England: his plan was that Edward I, a widower since the death of Eleanor of Castile in 1290, marry Philip&#x2019;s sister Marguerite, while Edward&#x2019;s son and heir, the Prince of Wales, be betrothed to Philip&#x2019;s daughter Isabella, then two years old. Once this peace had been sealed, Gascony could be returned to Edward I.<br><br> Boniface&#x2019;s suggestion appealed to both parties; it conjured up for Philip the tantalizing prospect of French influence being extended into England and his grandson eventually occupying the throne of that realm; and for Edward I, it promised the return of Gascony and a brilliant match for his son. As the daughter of the King of France and the Queen of Navarre, Isabella was a great prize in the marriage market: no Queen of England before her had boasted such a pedigree.<br><br> The deal was agreed in principle, and two weeks later, on 15 May, King Edward appointed Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, to negotiate both marriages. In March 1299, Parliament accepted the terms negotiated by Lincoln, and on 12 May following, plans were set in hand for the proxy betrothals. Three days later, the Earl of Lincoln, Amadeus, Count of Savoy, and the Earl of Warwick were appointed to act for Edward I and his son, and soon afterward, they departed for France. Edward I privately instructed the Count to find out as much as he could about the personal attributes of Marguerite of France, including the size of her foot and the width of her waist. The Count reported back that she was &#x201c;a fair and marvellously virtuous lady,&#x201d; pious and charitable.<br><br> The Treaty of Montreuil, which provided for Isabella&#x2019;s future betrothal to Edward of Caernarvon, was drawn up on 19 June, ratified by Edward I and the Prince of Wales on 4 July, and amplified by the Treaty of Chartres on 3 August. Under its terms, Philip was to give Isabella a dowry of �18,000, and once she became Queen of England, she was to have in dower all the lands formerly held by Eleanor of Castile, which were in the interim to be settled by Edward I on Marguerite; these amounted to �4,500 per annum. Should Edward I default on the treaties, he would forfeit Gascony; if Philip defaulted, he would pay Edward a fine of �100,000. On 29 August, at the instance of Edward I, the King and Queen of France gave solemn guarantees that the marriages would take place, and in September, Marguerite of France, then aged twenty at most, arrived in England and was married to the sixty-year-old Edward I in Canterbury Cathedral. Against the odds, this proved to be a successful and happy union, and produced three children. In October 1299, Philip IV finally ratified the Treaty of Montreuil. &#x201c;When love buds between great princes, it drives away bitter sobs from their subjects,&#x201d; commented a contemporary.<br><br> In 1300, the French occupied Flanders, but two years later, they were humiliatingly defeated and massacred by the Flemings at Courtrai. Throughout this time, Edward I had continued to press for the immediate restoration of Gascony, but Philip would not agree to this until after the Prince of Wales had fulfilled his promise to marry Isabella, who was still too young to wed.<br><br> By April 1303, Edward I was losing interest in the alliance and was beginning to look elsewhere for a bride for his son. At this crucial point, fearing a war on two fronts, Philip IV played his trump card and agreed to restore the duchy of Gascony to Edward without further delay; his intention was, as he reminded Edward II in 1308, that it should in time become the inheritance of his grandchildren, the heirs of Edward and Isabella. Edward I was now satisfied, and the Treaty of Paris, which officially restored the duchy, was signed on the same day that young Isabella and Edward of Caernarvon were betrothed. There would be further conflict between Edward I and Philip IV, but nothing serious enough to break this new alliance. Isabella was now destined to be Queen of England.<br><br> Isabella was probably born in 1295. There is conflicting evidence as to the year. Piers of Langtoft says she was &#x201c;only seven years of age&#x201d; in 1299, which places her birth in 1292, the date given in the Annals of Wigmore. Yet she is described by both the French chronicler Guillaume de Nangis and Thomas Walsingham as being twelve years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, which suggests she was born between January 1295 and January 1296. Given that twelve was the canonical age for marriage, and that in 1298, the Pope had stipulated that she should marry Prince Edward as soon as she reached that age, these dates are viable. In the same document of June 1298, the Pope describes Isabella as being &#x201c;under seven years,&#x201d; which places her birth at any time from 1291 onward. Furthermore, the Treaty of Montreuil (June 1299) provided for Isabella&#x2019;s betrothal and marriage to take place when she reached the respective canonical ages of seven and twelve. So she must have reached seven before May 1303, and twelve before January 1308.<br><br> It has been suggested that Isabella had already reached the canonical age for marriage in 1305, when she and the Prince of Wales nominated representatives for a marriage by proxy. This did not take place because of continued squabbles over Guienne, but the fact that these nominations were made has been held as evidence that Isabella had then reached, or was soon to reach, the age of twelve, which would place her date of birth around 1293. Yet this theory is contradicted by a papal dispensation issued by Clement V in November 1305, giving the young couple permission to marry at once even though Isabella had not yet reached her twelfth year and was at present in her tenth year. This suggests a birth date between November 1294 and November 1295. The waters are muddied still further by a decree issued by Philip IV in 1310, in which Isabella is referred to as his &#x201c;primogenita,&#x201d; or &#x201c;firstborn,&#x201d; which suggests that she was born in 1288 at the latest, as her eldest brother Louis was born in October 1289. This date conflicts with all the other evidence and is probably the result of an error on the part of the official drawing up the document.<br><br> In conclusion, the evidence in the papal dispensations and documents and the Treaty of Montreuil is likely to be more reliable, and taken together, it supports a birth date between May and November 1295, which in turn is supported by the statements of Guillaume de Nangis and Thomas Walsingham. This would make Isabella seven years old at the time of her betrothal and twelve years old at the time of her marriage.<br><br> Isabella grew up in a period when society regarded women as inferior beings. &#x201c;We should look on the female role as a deformity, though one which occurs in the ordinary course of nature,&#x201d; states a thirteenth-century edition of Aristotle&#x2019;s Generation of Animals. &#x201c;Woman is the confusion of man, an insatiable beast, a continuous anxiety, an incessant warfare, a daily ruin, a house of tempest and a hindrance to devotion,&#x201d; fulminated the misogynistic Vincent de Beauvais in the thirteenth century. In 1140, the canon lawyer Gratian asserted that &#x201c;women should be subject to their men. The natural order for mankind is that women should serve men and children their parents, for it is just that the lesser serve the greater.&#x201d;<br><br> The husband was his wife&#x2019;s lord and master: he was to her as Christ to the Church. Thus, if a woman murdered her husband, she was guilty of petty treason and could be burned at the stake. He, however, had the right to beat her if she displeased him; indeed, it was &#x201c;the husband&#x2019;s office to be his wife&#x2019;s chastiser.&#x201d; He was not supposed to kill or maim her through such punishment, although, according to the legal code enshrined in the Customs of Beauvais, &#x201c;in a number of cases men may be excused for the injuries they inflict on their wives, nor should the law intervene.&#x201d;<br><br> It was a woman&#x2019;s duty to love her husband and show him due obedience. In 1393, an anonymous Parisian writer instructed wives to obey their husbands&#x2019; commandments, since &#x201c;his pleasure should come before yours,&#x201d; and he advised them to &#x201c;cherish your husband&#x2019;s person, give him plenty of attention, and the cheer of other delights, privy frolics, lovings and secret matters. Do not be quarrelsome, but sweet, gentle and amiable. And if you do all this he will keep his heart for you, and he will care nothing for other women.&#x201d; The onus was always on the wife to maintain the stability of a marriage.<br><br> In law, women were regarded as infants, so they had few legal rights. They were viewed as assets in the marriage market, chattels in property or land deals, or prizes in the game of courtly love, and their roles were very narrowly defined. When a group of noblewomen attempted to usurp male privilege and arrange a tournament in 1348, God &#x201c;put their frivolity to rout by heavy thunderstorms and divers extraordinary tempests.&#x201d; In the fifteenth century, one of Joan of Arc&#x2019;s chief crimes was the adoption of male attire, which was seen as tantamount to heresy.<br><br> Some highborn ladies were taught to read and write, but they were the fortunate few. In the thirteenth century, Philip of Navarre thought that generally women &#x201c;should not learn to read or write unless they are going to be nuns, as much harm has come from such knowledge. For men will dare to send letters near them containing indecent requests in the form of songs or rhymes or tales, which they would never dare convey by message or word of mouth. And the Devil could soon lead her on to read the letters or&#x201d;&#x2014;even worse&#x2014;&#x201c;answer them.&#x201d;<br><br> Above all, in an age in which lineage and inheritance were paramount concerns, women were expected to be beyond moral reproach and to follow the virtuous example of the Virgin Mary. But because they were descended from Eve, who had committed the original sin, and were thus more likely to give in to temptation than men, they had to carefully guard their reputations. There was much comment on the frailty of women. &#x201c;Wheresoever beauty shows upon the face, there lurks much filth beneath the skin.&#x201d; This anonymous Parisian writer also observed that &#x201c;every good quality is obscured in the woman whose virginity or chastity falters. Women of sense avoid not only the sin itself, but also the appearance of it, so as to keep their good name. So you see in what peril a woman places her honour and that of her husband&#x2019;s lineage and of her children when she does not avoid the risks of such blame.&#x201d;<br><br> The Church taught that sex was primarily for procreation, not pleasure, and that intercourse was only permissible within marriage. Adultery was regarded as exceptionally sinful, especially on the part of a wife, for it jeopardized her husband&#x2019;s bloodline. In 1371, the author of the Book of the Knight of La Tour Landry insisted that &#x201c;women who fall in love with married men are worse than whores in brothels, and a gentlewoman who has enough to live on yet takes a lover does it from nothing but the carnal heat of lust.&#x201d; A husband who caught his wife in adultery had the legal right to kill her.<br><br> There were, of course, many women who circumvented the conventions. Many ran farms or businesses, or administered estates. Some even practiced as physicians. A few wrote books. And queens, by virtue of their exalted marital status, could exercise political authority and the power of patronage. Isabella would have been brought up to know exactly what was required of her as a daughter and as a wife, and she had before her the example of her mother, who was a queen in her own right.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle Ages</h2><p>This book has hardback covers.Ex-library,With usual stamps and markings,With owner&#39;s name inside cover.In fair condition, suitable as a study copy.No dust jacket.</p><p></p><h2>Chess from Morphy to Botwinnik</h2><p>Taking critical openings as his standpoint - the Ruy Lopez - Queen?s Gambit - English Opening and King?s Gambit - K�nig shows how chess technique advanced and became more sophisticated from the days of Morphy to the time of Botwinnik.

Brown, Jorie Graham, James Hillman, Mina Loy, Ron Padgett, Octavio Paz, Ezra Pound, Adrienne Rich, Rainer Maria Rilke, and William Carlos Williams. Each issue featured a diverse offering of poetry, translations, previously unpublished archival material, visual art, essays, and reviews. Sulfur was a hotbed for critical thinking and commentary, and also provided a home for the work of unknown and younger poets. In the course of its twenty year run, Sulfur maintained a reputation as the premier publication of alternative and experimental writing. This was due in no small measure to its impressive masthead of contributing editors and correspondents: Marjorie Perloff, James Clifford, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Keith Tuma, Allen Weiss, Jed Rasula, Charles Bernstein, Michael Palmer, Clark Coolidge, Jayne Cortez, Marjorie Welish, Jerome Rothenberg, Eliot Weinberger, managing editor Caryl Eshleman, and founding editor Clayton Eshleman. <br><br>A Sulfur Anthology offers readers an expanded view of artistic activity at the century's end. It's also a luminous document of international poetic vision. Many of the contributions have never been published outside of Sulfur, making this an indispensible collection of poetry in translation, and poetry in the world.</p><p>CLAYTON ESHLEMAN is an American poet, translator, and editor. He is a professor emeritus at Eastern Michigan University. Select back issues of Sulfur are available from the author&#39;s website."By the time Caterpillar ended in 1973, I was living in London, and I felt its demise like a serious blow. Eshleman returned with a vengeance, creating Sulfur, seven years later. ... Sulfur became the essential magazine I went to ... The anthology ... is a superb 650-page walk through the 46 issues of Sulfur. A treasure trove."&#x2015;Pierre Joris, <i>Jacket 2</i><p>"Begun in 1980 and finished by 2000, Sulfur marked with self-conscious brilliance the culmination cycle for the postwar literary magazine wave that had commenced in 1950 with Cid Corman's Origin. As an editor, Clayton Eshleman has continuously refined our understanding of poetry by means of intellectual engagement and real commitment to implicating the poet's artistry in the crucially extensive context of community, cosmos, history, myth, politics, and psyche. Truly, his lifelong dedication to assembling forms of international modernism, statements from depth psychology, texts of innovative poetry, and translations of world poetry is unsurpassed. Hence A Sulfur Anthology is guaranteed to further the refinement process that Eshleman initiated in 1980. From Ezra Pound to Barbara Mor, from Aim� C�saire to Rae Armantrout, from Robert Duncan to Ron Silliman, from Antonin Artaud to Amiri Baraka, from Mina Loy to Linh Dihn, from Ren� Char to Paul Celan, and much more&#x2015;this anthology radiates a monumental pulse that recounts all the turning points needed for readers in the twenty-first century to understand that Sulfur persists as the most indispensable literary magazine authorized by the Imagination."&#x2015;Kenneth Warren, author of Captain Poetry's Sucker Punch: A Guide to the Homeric Punkhole, 1980&#x2013;2012</p></p><h2>Booky: A trilogy</h2><p>Beatrice Thomson doesn&#39;t mind her funny nickname.

It is the period of such masterpieces as Mozart&#39;s &#34;The Magic Flute,&#34; Haydn&#39;s &#34;The Creation&#34; and Beethoven&#39;s &#34;Choral Symphony&#34;; of Gluck&#39;s innovative operas and the flamboyant ones of Rossini; and of fascinating and beautiful works of all kinds from such composers as C.P.E. Bach, Weber, and Schubert. But as Julian Rushton reminds us, there are many composers less celebrated today (Jommelli, Traetta, Hummel, Spontini, Mehel, to name a few) whose contribution is still being evaluated.

Edward, it should be noted, was still twitching upon the floor.<br><br>I stared at him, not quite taking in the fact that he had just collapsed at my feet. He lay, curled like a question mark, his evening suit ink-black against the white marble of the floor. He was writhing, his fingers knotted.<br><br>I leaned as close to him as my corset would permit.<br><br>"Edward, we have guests. Do get up. If this is some sort of silly prank&#x2014;"<br><br>"He is not jesting, my lady. He is convulsing."<br><br>An impatient figure in black pushed past me to kneel at Edward's side. He busied himself for a few brisk moments, palpating and pulse-taking, while I bobbed a bit, trying to see over his shoulder. Behind me the guests were murmuring, buzzing, pushing closer to get a look of their own. There was a little thrill of excitement in the air. After all, it was not every evening that a baronet collapsed senseless in his own music room. And Edward was proving rather better entertainment than the soprano we had engaged.<br><br>Through the press, Aquinas, our butler, managed to squeeze in next to my elbow.<br><br>"My lady?"<br><br>I looked at him, grateful to have an excuse to turn away from the spectacle on the floor.<br><br>"Aquinas, Sir Edward has had an attack."<br><br>"And would be better served in his own bed," said the gentleman from the floor. He rose, lifting Edward into his arms with a good deal of care and very little effort, it seemed. But Edward had grown thin in the past months. I doubted he weighed much more than I.<br><br>"Follow me," I instructed, although Aquinas actually led the way out of the music room. People moved slowly out of our path, as though they regretted the little drama ending so quickly. There were some polite murmurs, some mournful clucking. I heard snatches as I passed through them.<br><br>"The curse of the Greys, it is&#x2014;"<br><br>"So young. But of course his father never saw thirty-five."<br><br>"Never make old bones&#x2014;"<br><br>"Feeble heart. Pity, he was always such a pleasant fellow."<br><br>I moved faster, staring straight ahead so that I did not have to meet their eyes. I kept my gaze fixed on Aquinas' broad, black-wool back, but all the time I was conscious of those voices and the sound of footsteps behind me, the footsteps of the gentleman who was carrying my husband. Edward groaned softly as we reached the stairs and I turned. The gentleman's face was grim.<br><br>"Aquinas, help the gentleman&#x2014;"<br><br>"I have him," he interrupted, brushing past me. Aquinas obediently led him to Edward's bedchamber. Together they settled Edward onto the bed, and the gentleman began to loosen his clothes. He flicked a glance toward Aquinas.<br><br>"Has he a doctor?"<br><br>"Yes, sir. Doctor Griggs, Golden Square."<br><br>"Send for him. Although I dare say it will be too late."<br><br>Aquinas turned to me where I stood, hovering on the threshold. I never went into Edward's room. I did not like to do so now. It felt like an intrusion, a trespass on his privacy.<br><br>"Shall I send for Lord March as well, my lady?"<br><br>I blinked at Aquinas. "Why should Father come? He is no doctor."<br><br>But Aquinas was quicker than I. I had thought the gentleman meant that Edward would have recovered from his attack by the time Doctor Griggs arrived. Aquinas, who had seen more of the world than I, knew better.<br><br>He looked at me, his eyes carefully correct, and then I understood why he wanted to send for Father. As head of the family he would have certain responsibilities.<br><br>I nodded slowly. "Yes, send for him." I moved into the room on reluctant legs. I knew I should be there, doing whatever little bit that I could for Edward. But I stopped at the side of the bed. I did not touch him.<br><br>"And Lord Bellmont?" Aquinas queried.<br><br>I thought for a moment. "No, it is Friday. Parliament is sitting late."<br><br>That much was a mercy. Father I could cope with. But not my eldest brother as well. "And I suppose you ought to call for the carriages. Send everyone home. Make my apologies."<br><br>He left us alone then, the stranger and I. We stood on opposite sides of the bed, Edward convulsing between us. He stopped after a moment and the gentleman placed a finger at his throat.<br><br>"His pulse is very weak," he said finally. "You should prepare yourself."<br><br>I did not look at him. I kept my eyes fixed on Edward's pale face. It shone with sweat, its surface etched with lines of pain. This was not how I wanted to remember him.<br><br>"I have known him for more than twenty years," I said finally, my voice tight and strange. "We were children together. We used to play pirates and knights of the Round Table. Even then, I knew his heart was not sound. He used to go quite blue sometimes when he was overtired. This is not unexpected."<br><br>I looked up then to find the stranger's eyes on me. They were the darkest eyes I had ever seen, witch-black and watchful. His gaze was not friendly. He was regarding me coldly, as a merchant will appraise a piece of goods to determine its worth. I dropped my eyes at once.<br><br>"Thank you for your concern for my husband's health, sir. You have been most helpful. Are you a friend of Edward's?"<br><br>He did not reply at once. Edward made a noise in the back of his throat and the stranger moved swiftly, rolling him onto his side and thrusting a basin beneath his mouth. Edward retched, horribly, groaning. When he finished, the gentleman put the basin to the side and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief. Edward gave a little whimper and began to shiver. The gentleman watched him closely.<br><br>"Not a friend, no. A business associate," he said finally. "My name is Nicholas Brisbane."<br><br>"I am&#x2014;"<br><br>"I know who you are, my lady."<br><br>Startled at his rudeness, I looked up, only to find those eyes again, fixed on me with naked hostility. I opened my mouth to reproach him, but Aquinas appeared then. I turned to him, relieved.<br><br>"Aquinas?"<br><br>"The carriages are being brought round now, my lady. I have sent Henry for Doctor Griggs and Desmond for his lordship. Lady Otterbourne and Mr. Phillips both asked me to convey their concern and their willingness to help should you have need of them."<br><br>"Lady Otterbourne is a meddlesome old gossip and Mr. Phillips would be no use whatsoever. Send them home."<br><br>I was conscious of Mr. Brisbane behind me, listening to every word. I did not care. For some unaccountable reason, the man thought ill of me already. I did not mind if he thought worse.<br><br>Aquinas left again, but I did not resume my post by the bed. I took a chair next to the door and remained there, saying nothing and wondering what was going to happen to all of the food. We had ordered far too much in any event. Edward never liked to run short. I could always tell Cook to serve it in the servants' hall, but after a few days even the staff would tire of it. Before I could decide what to do with the lobster patties and salad molds, Aquinas entered again, leading Doctor Griggs. The elderly man was perspiring freely, patting his ruddy face with a handkerchief and gasping. He had taken the stairs too quickly. I rose and he took my hand.<br><br>"I was afraid of this," he murmured. "The curse of the Greys, it is. All snatched before their time. My poor girl." I smiled feebly at him. Doctor Griggs had attended my mother at my birth, as well as her nine other confinements. We had known each other too long to stand on ceremony. He patted my hand and moved to the bed. He felt for Edward's pulse, shaking his head as he did so. Edward vomited again, and Doctor Griggs watched him carefully, examining the contents of the basin. I turned away.<br><br>I tried not to hear the sounds coming from the bed, the groans and the rattling breaths. I would have stopped my ears with my hands, but I knew it would look childish and cowardly. Griggs continued his examination, but before he finished Aquinas stepped into the room.<br><br>"Lord March, my lady." He moved aside and Father entered.<br><br>"Julia," he said, opening his arms. I went into them, burying my face against his waistcoat. He smelled of tobacco and book leather. He kept one arm tucked firmly around me as he looked over my head.<br><br>"Griggs, you damned fool. Julia should have been sent away."<br><br>The doctor made some reply, but I did not hear it. My father was pushing me gently out the door. I tried to look past him, to see what they were doing to Edward, but Father moved his body and prevented me. He gave me a sad, gentle smile. Anyone else might have mistaken that smile, but I did not. I knew he expected obedience. I nodded.<br><br>"I shall wait in my room."<br><br>"That would be best. I will come when there is something to tell."<br><br>My maid, Morag, was waiting for me. She helped me out of my silk gown and into something more suitable. She offered me warm milk or brandy, but I knew I would never be able to hold anything down. I only wanted to sit, watching the clock on the mantel as it ticked away the minutes left.<br><br>Morag continued to fuss, poking at the fire and muttering complaints about the work to come. She was right about that. There would be much work for her when I put on widow's weeds. It was unlucky to keep crepe in the house, I reminded myself. It would have to be sent for after Edward passed. I thought about such things&#x2014;crepe for the mirrors, black plumes for the horses&#x2014;because then I did not have to think about what was happening in Edward's room. It was rather like waiting for a birth, these long, tense minutes of sitting, straining one's ears on tiptoe for the slightest sound. I expected to hear something, but the walls were thick and I heard nothing. Even when the clock struck midnight, the little voice on my mantel chiming twelve times, I could not hear the tall case clock in the hall. I started to mention the peculiarity of it to Morag, because one could always hear the case clock from any room in the house, when I realized what it meant.<br><br>"Morag, the clocks have stopped."<br><br>She looked at me, her lips parted to speak, but she said nothing. Instead she bowed her head and began to pray. A moment later, the door opened. It was Father. He said nothing. I went to him and his hand cradled my head like a benediction. He held me for a very long time, as he had not done since I was a child.<br><br>"It is all right, my dear," he said finally, sounding older and more tired than I had ever heard him. "It is over."<br><br>But of course, he was entirely wrong. It was only the beginning.<br><br>I he days leading up to the funeral were dire, as such days almost always are. Too many people, saying too many pointless things&#x2014;the same pointless things that everyone always says. Such a tragedy, so unexpected, so very, very dreadful. And no matter how much you would like to scream at them to go away and leave you alone, you cannot, even if they are your family.<br><br>Especially if they are your family. In the week following Edward's death, I was inundated with March relations. They flocked from the four corners of the kingdom, as mindful of the pleasures of London as their family duty. As etiquette did not permit me to be seen in public, they came to me at Grey House. The men&#x2014;uncles, brothers, cousins&#x2014;briefly paid their respects to Edward, laid out with awful irony in the music room, then spent the rest of their time arguing politics and arranging for amusements that would get them out of the house. My only consolation was the fact that, like locusts, they managed to finish off all of the leftover food from the night Edward died.<br><br>The women were little better. Under Aunt Hermia's direction, the funeral was planned, the burial arranged, and my household turned entirely on its head. She carried around with her a notebook filled with endless lists that she was forever consulting with a frown or ticking off with a satisfied smile. There was the crepe to be ordered, mourning wreaths, funeral cards, black-bordered writing paper to be purchased, the announcement for the <em>Times, </em>and of course my wardrobe.<br><br>"Unrelieved black," she informed me, her brow furrowed as she struggled to make out her own handwriting. "There must be no sheen to the fabric and no white or grey," she reminded me.<br><br>"I know." I tried not to think of the new gowns, delivered only the day before Edward's death. They were pale, soft colours, the shades of new flowers in spring. I should have to give them to Morag to sell at the secondhand stalls now. They would never dye dark enough to pass for mourning.<br><br>"No jewels, except hair jewelry," Aunt Hermia was saying. I repressed a shudder. I had never warmed to the notion of wearing a dead person's hair braided around my wrist or knotted at my ears. "After a year and a day, you will be permitted black fabric with a sheen, and deep purple or grey with a black stripe. If you choose to wear black after that time, you may relieve it with touches of white. Although," she added with a conspiratorial look, "I think a year is quite enough, and you must do what you like after that."<br><br>I glanced at my sister Portia, who was busy feeding her ancient pug some rather costly crab fritters laced with caviar. She looked up and wrinkled her nose at me over Puggy's head.<br><br>"Don't fret, dearest. You have always looked striking in black."<br><br>I grimaced at her and turned back to Aunt Hermia, who was deliberately ignoring Portia's flippancy. As children, we had been quite certain that Aunt Hermia was partially deaf. It was only much later when we realized that there was absolutely nothing wrong with her hearing. The trick of hearing only what she wanted had enabled her to raise her widowed brother's ten children with some measure of sanity.<br><br>"Black stockings of course," she was saying, "and we shall have to order some new handkerchiefs edged in black."<br><br>"I am working on them now," said my sister Bee from the corner. Industrious as her namesake, she kept her head bowed over her work, her needle whipping through the fine lawn with its load of thin black silk.<br><br></p><h2>Shanghai Diary: A Young Girl&#39;s Journey from Hitler&#39;s Hate to War-Torn China</h2><p>By the late 1930s, Europe sat on the brink of a world war. As the holocaust approached, many Jewish families in Germany fled to one of the only open port available to them: Shanghai. Once called &#34;the armpit of the world,&#34; Shanghai ultimately served as the last resort for tens of thousands of Jews desperate to escape Hitler&#39;s &#34;Final Solution.&#34; Against this backdrop, 11-year-old Ursula Bacon and her family made the difficult 8,000-mile voyage to Shanghai, with its promise of safety. But instead of a storybook China, they found overcrowded streets teeming with peddlers, beggars, opium dens, and prostitutes.

But in this new biography, Ben Russell tells a much bigger, richer story, peering over Watt&#x2019;s shoulder to more fully explore the processes he used and how his ephemeral ideas were transformed into tangible artifacts. Over the course of the book, Russell reveals as much about the life of James Watt as he does a history of Britain&#x2019;s early industrial transformation and the birth of professional engineering.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> To record this fascinating narrative, Russell draws on a wide range of resources&#x2014;from archival material to three-dimensional objects to scholarship in a diversity of fields from ceramics to antique machine-making. He explores Watt&#x2019;s early years and interest in chemistry and examines Watt&#x2019;s partnership with Matthew Boulton, with whom he would become a successful and wealthy man. In addition to discussing Watt&#x2019;s work and incredible contributions that changed societies around the world, Russell looks at Britain&#x2019;s early industrial transformation. Published in association with the Science Museum London, and with seventy illustrations,&nbsp;<i>James Watt</i>&nbsp;is not only an intriguing exploration of the engineer&#x2019;s life, but also an illuminating journey into the broader practices of invention in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&nbsp;<i>Published in association with the Science Museum, London</i></p><p><b>Ben Russell </b>is curator of mechanical engineering at the Science Museum, London.&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The first engineer to be commemorated in Westminster Abbey, Watt was long celebrated as a heroic figure who arrived at his epochal discoveries by virtue of lonely genius. Russell helps correct that picture by celebrating Watt as a doer and a maker, rooted in the artisanal culture of his times. Steeped in scholarship, as well as nitty-gritty knowledge of the artefacts of the Industrial Revolution,&nbsp;<i>James Watt: Making the World Anew</i>&nbsp;will prove fascinating to anyone who wants to know how and why steam engines were made.&#x201d;&nbsp; (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In 1924, London&#x2019;s Science Museum acquired the entire workshop of engineer James Watt, left almost untouched in the attic of his house in Birmingham since his death more than a century before. The museum put a recreation of the workshop on permanent display in 2011. This workshop inspired Russell, the Science Museum&#x2019;s curator of mechanical engineering, to write his engaging&nbsp;<i>James Watt: Making the World Anew</i>.&nbsp;. . . The diversity of Watt&#x2019;s interests and activities was astonishing, even when compared with the achievements of his Enlightenment contemporaries.&#x201d;&nbsp; (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Russell moves beyond the steam engine to look at Watt&#x2019;s many other pioneering inventions.&#x201d;&nbsp; (<i>Observer</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Celebrated for his industrial inventions, Watt himself now belongs to Britain&#x2019;s heritage industry. Russell has provided a refreshingly original insight into the life and activities not only of this national hero, but also of his many less famous colleagues who together transformed traditional craftsmanship into industrial innovation.&#x201d; (<i>British Journal for the History of Science</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Comprehensive and well-researched . . . generous and fascinating collection of illustrations. . . . With a sure touch, Ben Russell makes it clear that there was far more to Watt than steam and steam engines.&#x201d; (<i>Methodist Recorder</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Many more examples could be given, such is the richness of this book, many more than can be mentioned in a short review. . . . Russell supports his ideas with copious references, both from the literature of Watt&#x2019;s own day, as well as others from scholars of today. These cover an enormous range of sources which strengthen Russell&#x2019;s arguments and compel us to think seriously about the themes he proposes.&#x201d; (<i>International Journal for the History of Engineering &amp; Technology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A compelling book that should be essential reading for anyone who is interested in investigating the origins of technological innovation.&#x201d; (<i>ISIS</i>)</p><h2>Japan&#39;s Imperial Conspiracy</h2><p>Hardcover;No Volume Listed on Book 1239 p. : Includes Illustrations. 1971 William Morrow and Company, Inc.

Visit this award-winning author-illustrator on the Web at www.cherylharness.com.Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;Harness combines a breezy tone with exhaustively researched texts to produce not only exemplary life stories, but also snapshots of the periods. As the author makes amply clear, Standish was a hotheaded but effective secretary of defense for the struggling Plymouth Colony. His willingness to make a show of force and to invest both time and effort (his own and others') into constructing fortresses probably saved the fledgling colony from untimely destruction. The steps Whitman took to become a missionary, her historic journey to Oregon country, her years at the Waiilatpu Mission, and her tragic death at age 39 are all covered. The narrative is much enhanced by the frequent use of excerpts from her letters home. In each book, a running time line lists significant events taking place in Europe, Africa, and Asia. The texts incorporate information on the state of technology and how that impacted the journeys each individual made, the force and impact of religious beliefs and worldviews, and significant societal beliefs and mores. Black-and-white line illustrations extend the texts beautifully, as do the maps. The bibliographies and indexes are excellent. While readers may not pick these titles up on their own, Harness's style (though a bit arch in tone at times) will hold their interest. Much preferable to most standard series titles, such as Louis Sabin's <i>Narcissa Whitman: Brave Pioneer</i> (Troll, 1997), these books have a place in most school collections.&#x2014;<i>Ann Welton, Helen B.

It is an extraordinary history. Over the centuries since the death of Christ, his followers have known adversity and defeat as well as glory and power &#x2013; the victories of Charlemagne, or the Crusades, matched by those of Hun, Moor, or Turk. Christianity has borne persecution and division, each taking its terrible toll martyrs. It has assumed unexpected forms, from fourth-century Arianism to seventeenth-century Quakerism. It has been the cause and the victim of war and holocaust. It has been challenged by the findings of such scientists as Galileo and Darwin and &#x2013; never more markedly than our own 21st century &#x2013; by a progressive secularism. Yet in every sphere of Western life and achievement &#x2013; in our art and literature, our politics and our law, our philosophy &#x2013; we find the enduring legacy of the Christian experience. Here is a sound, readable guide to Christianity as a whole &#x2013; its origins, its revolutionary impact on human affairs, its development over twenty-one centuries, its role as a fundamental, powerful force in our world and our lives.</p><p></p><h2>The Deadliest Sin</h2><p>Intriguing interlinked mysteries from the Medieval Murderers group, including Karen Maitland, Susanna Gregory, Bernard Knight, Philip Gooden, Ian Morson, Michael Jecks, and Simon Beaufort.<br><br>In the spring of 1348, tales of fast-moving poisonous clouds capable of destroying the populations of entire cities&#x2014;even countries&#x2014;begin spreading throughout England.

A.: Tales from the Los Angeles River</h2><p>In &#34;Rio L.A: Tales from the Los Angeles River,&#34; the Los Angeles River is presented in its diverse context, a waterway as unique as the city through which it meanders. According to Los Angeles Magazine (August 2001) &#34;Morrison, Lamonica and Angel City Press should be commended for this love letter to one of Los Angeles&#39;s most ill-used natural treasures.&#34; The subject of tremendous controversy, the L.A River is quickly becoming a revered geographical icon that for too long was left neglected and unappreciated. Today it exposes an urban psychology unimaginable in the 21st Century; a river where nature, commerce, concrete and the trails of humanity fight for space, and even for existence. In a city whose history has been explored time and again, little is known of this majestic river. In &#34;Rio L.A.&#34; Morrison and Lamonica present the culture that evolves around this virtual oasis in a land of super highways and celluloid dreams, while tracing its history and giving the Ri! ver its voice. Rio L.A magnificently captures both the reality and the spirit of the Los Angeles River, a concrete masterpiece of clandestine beauty that stretches from the mountains of the Santa Susannas to the mouth of Long Beach Harbor. Accompanying the full-color photographs is a powerful commentary on the history, evolution, mythology and culture of the L.A River: the very source of life to the City of Los Angeles.</p><p>The Los Angeles River.

Though Koontz wrote both versions and they share the same basic plot, the two novels are very different. The earlier version has a dual narrative - with some chapters written from the perspective of Susan, the story&#39;s heroine, and others based on the observations of Proteus, the rogue computer that imprisons her. The later version is written entirely from the point of view of Proteus.

Blumay, Hammer's public relations consultant for 25 years and architect of his public persona, describes in astonishing detail the methods by which both the American public and his stockholders were hoodwinked into believing that Hammer was a generous philanthropist, a brilliant businessman, and a scholarly art collector. The widely held perception that this noted capitalist was an officially sanctioned good-will ambassador to the Soviet Union was totally bogus. Blumay reveals that Hammer's seven-decades-long relationship with the former Soviet Union was complicated and, like most of his relationships, nefarious. Readers will discover a man who was unbelievably ruthless and cruel, demanding unquestioning loyalty of his employees and devoid of any redeeming qualities. Even in old age, Hammer continued to sow seeds of misery in the lives of the people he touched. Recommended for public libraries.<br><i>- Andrea C. Dragon, Coll. of St. Elizabeth, Convent Station, N.J.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this relentlessly grim portrait of Armand Hammer, his former public relations consultant Blumay and journalist and novelist Edwards characterize the powerful international businessman as a skinflint, a womanizer, a liar, a browbeater of his staff and, above all, a man obsessed with money, power and fame. Ironically, Blumay in this book undoes his 25-year-long attempt to build an image of Hammer (1898-1990) as "caring, compassionate and wise." Unfortunately, the book lacks an organized overview and, although it proceeds chronologically, it is difficult to follow. Moreover, while Blumay offers insider details, the book strains credibility. It lacks both footnotes and bibliography, relies on deceased sources such as Hammer's brother Victor for damaging information and serves up numerous verbatim quotes from decades-old conversations.

("Humph! The things that come down from my sky!") He wants something <i>else</i>, something uniquely his own, so he calls in his royal magicians ("Shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff. Fista, wista, mista-cuff. We are men of groans and howls, mystic men who eat boiled owls"). Happy to oblige, the magicians tell the king they can make "oobleck" fall from the sky, only nobody--not even the magicians--knows just what oobleck is. But after a night of arcane incantations, everyone in the kingdom gets a taste of the stuff (in the case of the Captain of the Guard, literally!), as the green, gluey goo gums up everything in sight.</p><p> Of course, Bartholomew tries to help, but it's up to the king to save the day, as he learns to utter not magic words but simple words with magic in them: "I'm sorry."

Then his marriage crumbles and his career as a mystery writer falls apart. But after he is killed in a hit-and-run accident, David quickly learns that he will face his most harrowing challenges as a wraith in the Shadowlands. And David soon learns that power is a blade that cuts two ways.</p><p>First hardcover dark fantasy entry in what looks like a series to be called Wraith: The Oblivion, by the Maine author of 13 horror novels. The astral plane has a long and vivid history in nonfiction studies of the paranormal. Hautala, however, keeps to suspense clich&#x201a;s when his hero, David Robinson, wakes up dead in the Shadowlands. Killed when hit by a truck, David is now a wraith, and the Shadowlands is peopled with fearful shapechangers, the worst being the barking barghests and the slavers who want to cart David off in chains and dump him into the forges of Stygia. And then there are the Ferrymen, who, like Charon, will take you to a far shore that may be either horrible or a place of transcendent peace- -one can't tell about these Ferrymen's promises. David is looking for Karen, his child, whose death five years earlier contributed to his divorce from Sarah, a research librarian. David is (or was) a suicidally depressed midlist mystery writer whose last three books slid to oblivion and whose agent has just dumped him. Unless you're a witty stylist like the late Kingsley Amis, the basic facts about David promise little toward generating an interesting hero--which he's not. Meanwhile, back in the world of the living, Sarah seduces Tony Ranieri, a law student ten years her junior and a dreary stud who possesses one of the three lost knives of Jack the Ripper, which have disappeared from a museum. The knife has savage powers and demands blood, preferably Sarah's--a danger of which David, temporarily slipping back into our world, tries unavailingly to warn her. Eventually, he himself gets the knife, whose power can bring oblivion in the Shadowlands. . . . Murky, but not perky. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

How, then, does a nine-lived enchanter cope with a place where witchcraft is utterly forbidden, yet where magic still seems to break out like measles -- all over the place! The note said: SOMEONE IN THIS CLASS IS A WITCH. It was written in ordinary blue ballpoint and had appeared between two of the homework books Mr Crossley was marking. Anyone could have written it, but the most awful thing was, the note might be true -- for this was a school for witch-orphans. The last thing Miss Cadwallader, the Headteacher, would want was a visit from the Divisional Inquisitor. Mr Crossley wondered what to do about it!</p><p>Someone in 6B is a witch. And, in the alternate reality described in Diana Wynne Jones's <i>Witch Week</i>, that's not at all a good thing to be. Jones plunks her readers directly into the life of Larwood House, a school in a present-day England that's a lot like the world we know, except for one major difference: witches are everywhere, and they are ruthlessly hunted by inquisitors. With witty, erudite writing, Jones tells of the adventures of the class of 6B as they set about to discover who among them is a witch. Clearly it's not the popular Simon or the perfect Theresa. Could it be fat Nan or sluggish Charles? Mysterious Nirupam or shifty-eyed Brian? By the climax of the book (which, by the way, involves saving the world), being a witch has become a badge of honor rather than a mark of shame. <p> Jones skillfully and seamlessly switches from one point of view to another, creating a comic companion piece to <i>Lord of the Flies</i> as she shows with perfect understanding the way children torment each other--and save each other. She neatly interweaves the dramatic plot with knowing descriptions of school life, as when lumpen Nan warily observes the popular girls: "At lessons, she discovered that Theresa and her friends had started a new craze. That was a bad sign. They were always more than usually pleased with themselves at the start of a craze... The craze was white knitting, white and clean and fluffy, which you kept wrapped in a towel so that it would stay clean. The classroom filled with mutters of, 'Two purl, one plain, twist two....'" <i>Witch Week</i> is a hugely entertaining book that doesn't condescendingly beat children over the head with its humane message of acceptance. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Diana Wynne Jones spent her childhood in Essex and has been writing fantasy novels for children since 1973.

They embark on a furtive love affair, and are soon cloistered in a premature intimacy by the unrest roiling their city. When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors &#x2015; doors that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price. As the violence escalates, Nadia and Saeed decide that they no longer have a choice. Leaving their homeland and their old lives behind, they find a door and step through . . .</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2017:</strong> When Nadia and Saeed fall in love in a distant unnamed city, they are just like any other young couple. But soon bullets begin to fly, fighter jets streak the sky, and curfews fall. As the spell of violence spreads, they flee their country, leaving behind their loved ones. Early in <em>Exit West</em>, the author Mohsin Hamid explains that geography is destiny, and in the case of his two young lovers, geography dictates that they must leave. Hamid offers up a fantastical device to deliver his refugees to places: they pass through magic doors. Rather than unmooring the story from reality, this device, as well as a few other fantastical touches, makes the book more poignant and focused, pointing our attention to the emotions of exile rather than the mechanics. Surrounded by other refugees, Nadia and Saeed try to establish their places in the world, putting up different responses to their circumstances. The result is a novel that is personal, not pedantic, an intimate human story about an experience shared by countless people of the world, one that most Americans just witness on television. --<em>Chris Schluep , The Amazon Book Review </em></p><b>Mohsin Hamid </b>is the author of the international bestsellers <i>Exit West</i> and <i>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</i>, both finalists for the Man Booker Prize.

Based largely on contemporary documents and on original and firmly documented furniture, together with the latest modern scholarship, it provides a closely-reasoned analysis of changing furniture styles, together with much technical information on materials and processes. The author&#39;s radical new approach to the stylistic and structural analysis of furniture will change perceptions of English furniture and establish a new chronology for late seventeenth and early eighteenth century English furniture. This extensively illustrated book is the first comprehensive review of the subject for nearly one hundred years. Part one focuses on Charles II and James II, 1660-1688 with chapters on The Restoration, Case Furniture, Seat Furniture, Tables, Stands and Mirrors and Lacquer, japanning and varnish. The second part focuses on William III and Queen A</p><p>Adam Bowett is a lecturer in Furniture History at Brunel University, the author of numerous articles, conference contributor, etc. He is a contributor to the BBC&#39;s Antiques Roadshow.

Especially interesting are his interactions with Caruso and Strauss, and his time under Nazi rule. Transcribed from interviews, and translated from the 1970 German edition. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanBohm (1894-1981) was a celebrated conductor of classic German mold who had a solid but only occasionally spectacular career that spanned almost five decades. He was close to, and a splendid interpreter of, Richard Strauss, and the most intriguing pages in this pedestrian account of his life (published in Germany some 20 years ago) are his reminiscences of that master. Mozart, Bruckner and Berg were the author's other specialties, though he has nothing particularly revealing to say about them. Bohm came under shadow at the end of WW II for having continued to conduct in Nazi Germany, and although he seems never to have joined the party, it was disingenuous of him to assume he could instantly resume his life as if nothing had happened. As in the cases of Karajan, Furtwangler and others, the Nazis made much of the great music that continued to be created by men who failed to dissociate themselves from official life under the regime. Bohm has very little of interest to say about musical life in wartime--and indeed his memoir suggests, even more than most such, that musicians are not of great interest outside their specialty.

Eliot's masterpiece, and is not only one of the key works of modernism but also one of the greatest poetic achievements of the twentieth century. A richly allusive pilgrimage of spiritual and psychological torment and redemption, Eliot's poem exerted a revolutionary influence on his contemporaries, summoning forth a rich new poetic language, breaking decisively with Romantic and Victorian poetic traditions. Kenneth Rexroth was not alone in calling Eliot "the representative poet of the time, for the same reason that Shakespeare and Pope were of theirs. He articulated the mind of an epoch in words that seemed its most natural expression."<br><br>As influential as his verse, T.S. Eliot's criticism also exerted a transformative effect on twentieth-century letter, and this new edition of <i>The Waste Land and Other Writings</i> includes a selection of Eliot's most important essays. <br><br>In her new Introduction, Mary Karr dispels some of the myths of the great poem's inaccessibility and sheds fresh light on the ways in which "The Waste Land" illuminates contemporary experience.</p><p>&#x201c;I can only repeat, but with the urgency of fifty years ago: READ HIM.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Ezra Pound</b><b>T.S.

They are an elite ground fire-fighting corps of men and women highly trained to understand the scientific nature of fire in order to go deep into the heart of a wildfire, beyond the reach of hose lines, to limit the destruction of land and wildlife. As more homes are being built into the natural landscape, the role of the hotshot in fighting fire has become increasingly important. With stunning pictures and an action-packed text, fine artist and volunteer firefighter Chris L. Demarest here captures the spirit of the dedicated hotshots and the real-life drama of the dangerous work they must do every day.</p><p><b>Chris L. Demarest</b> is a fine artist and volunteer firefighter. He has a young son and lives in Lebanon, New Hampshire.K-Gr. 2. Similar in subject and format to Demarest's <i>Firefighters A to Z</i> (2000) and <i>Smoke Jumpers One to Ten</i> (2002), this large-format book features hotshots, "the elite ground fire-fighting corps with permanent stations dotted throughout the western United States." Sparks from a passing train ignite a fire that rages out of control, burning homes as well as brush-covered countryside. The hotshots respond quickly, racing up a mountain, setting a "backburn," and protecting themselves with heat-resistant coverings when the blaze overtakes them. After their backburn stops the fire, they reload their tools on the truck, ready for the next call. The rhythm of the short, rhyming text sounds a bit clunky, and some terminology may confuse the uninitiated. But the story builds to a terrific climax, and the dramatic, intensely colored pastel illustrations are riveting. In the appended note, Demarest describes the process of battling wildfires, explains the fire-fighting terms used in the book, and lists books, videos, and Web sites for further information. Sure to enthrall children with an interest in fire fighting. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Off the ice, the history of the Seals is practically a tale of how not to run a franchise. The team joined the NHL in 1967 as part of the &#34;Second Six&#34; expansion teams and stayed in Oakland until moving to Cleveland in 1976. The Seals had seven different ownership groups in nine years and chaos reigned throughout the process. This book shows you the inner workings of a hockey club that was always on the brink of bankruptcy and/or relocating and takes you behind the scenes of many of the mistakes made by NHL owners and executives during the early years of expansion. It also chronicles the crazy days of ownership by Charlie Finley, a man who admittedly knew nothing about hockey but knew he wanted to run his team his way. Hilarity and disaster resulted.On the ice, the Seals met with little success but were never dull. In nine years, the team had to put up with white skates, few fans and a cast of characters that were uniqueThis book allows the players and coaches to tell their own story. More than 110 interviews were conducted with former Seals players, owners, coaches and employees to get a clear picture of what it was like to play in the NHL in the 60s and 70s. The rise of the WHA, continuing expansion and more hilarious stories of what really happens to an NHL team on the road and in the locker room.

And throughout, Bova has shown our cosmic neighborhood as we know it to be, giving us a sense of Venus and Jupiter and the Asteroid Belt and Mars that's as up-to-date as the latest observations. For the last two decades have been a golden age of near-Earth astronomy and observation, and in his novels Bova has made dramatic use of our newest knowledge.<br><br>But during that time Bova has also written short fiction about some of the same events and characters---Sam Gunn, Martin Humphries, Klaus Fuchs, Dan Randolph, the Asteroid Wars.

Once she let the hood fall back I damned near dropped the coat. I recognized her. Who could forget her? She was exquisite, so stunningly beautiful that even irrepressible Sam Gunn was struck speechless. More beautiful than any woman I had ever seen.<br>But haunted.<br>It was more than her big, soulful eyes. More than the almost frightened way she had of glancing all around as she entered Sam&#x2019;s office, as if expecting someone to leap out of hiding at her. She looked <i>tragic</i>, lovely and doomed and tragic.<br>&#x201c;Mr. Gunn, I need your help,&#x201d; she said to Sam. Those were the first words she spoke, even before she took the chair that I was holding for her. Her voice was like the sigh of a breeze in a midnight forest.<br>Sam was standing behind his desk, on the hidden little platform back there that makes him look taller than his real 165 centimeters. As I said, even Sam was speechless. Leather-tongued, clatter-mouthed Sam Gunn simply stood and stared at her in stupified awe.<br>Then he found his voice. &#x201c;Anything,&#x201d; he said, in a choked whisper. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d do anything for you.&#x201d;<br>Despite the fact that Sam was getting married in just three weeks&#x2019; time, it was obvious that he&#x2019;d tumbled head over heels for Amanda Cunningham the minute he saw her. Instantly. Sam Gunn was always falling in love, even more often than he made fortunes of money and lost them again. But this time it looked as if he&#x2019;d really been struck by the thunderbolt.<br>If she weren&#x2019;t so beautiful, so troubled, seeing the two of them together would have been almost ludicrous. Amanda Cunningham looked like a Greek goddess, except that her shoulder-length hair was radiant golden blond. She wore a modest knee-length sheath of delicate pink that couldn&#x2019;t hide the curves of her ample body. And those eyes! They were bright china blue, but deep, terribly troubled, unbearably sad.<br>And there was Sam: stubby as a worn old pencil, with a bristle of red hair and his gap-toothed mouth hanging open. Sam had the kind of electricity in him that made it almost impossible for him to stand still for more than thirty seconds at a time. Yet he stood gaping at Amanda Cunningham, as tongue-tied as a teenager on his first date.<br>And me. Compared to Sam I&#x2019;m a rugged outdoorsy type of guy. Of course, I wear lifts in my boots and a tummy tingler that helps keep my gut flat. Women have told me that my face is kind of cute in a cherubic sort of way, and I believe them&#x2014;until I look in the mirror and see the pouchy eyes and the trim black beard that covers my receding chin. What did it matter? Amanda Cunningham didn&#x2019;t even glance at me; her attention was focused completely on Sam.<br>It was really comical. Yet I wasn&#x2019;t laughing.<br>Sam just stared at her, transfixed. Bewitched. I was still holding one of the leather-covered chairs for her. She sat down without looking at it, as if she were accustomed to there being a chair wherever she chose to sit.<br>&#x201c;You must understand, Mr. Gunn,&#x201d; she said softly. &#x201c;What I ask is very dangerous...&#x201d;<br>Still standing in front of his high-backed swivel chair, his eyes never leaving hers, Sam waved one hand as if to scoff at the thought of danger.<br>&#x201c;It involves flying out to the Belt,&#x201d; she continued.<br>&#x201c;Anywhere,&#x201d; Sam said. &#x201c;For you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To find my husband.&#x201d;<br>That broke the spell. Definitely.<br>Sam&#x2019;s company was S. Gunn Enterprises, Unlimited. He was involved in a lot of different operations, including hauling freight between the Earth and Moon, and transporting equipment out to the Asteroid Belt. He was also dickering to build a gambling casino and hotel on the Moon, but that&#x2019;s another story.<br>&#x201c;To find your husband?&#x201d; Sam asked her, his face sagging with disappointment.<br>&#x201c;My ex-husband,&#x201d; said Amanda Cunningham. &#x201c;We were divorced several years ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Sam brightened.<br>&#x201c;My current husband is Martin Humphries,&#x201d; she went on, her voice sinking lower.<br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Sam repeated, plopping down into his chair like a man shot in the heart. &#x201c;Amanda Cunningham Humphries.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;<i>The</i> Martin Humphries?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she repeated, almost whispering it.<br>Mrs. Martin Humphries. I&#x2019;d seen pictures of her, of course, and vids on the society nets. I&#x2019;d even glimpsed her in person once, across a ballroom crowded with the very wealthiest of the wealthy. Even in the midst of all that glitter and opulence she had glowed like a beautiful princess in a cave full of trolls. Martin Humphries was towing her around the party like an Olympic trophy. I popped my monocle and almost forgot the phony German accent I&#x2019;d been using all evening. That was a couple of years ago, when I&#x2019;d been working the society circuit selling shares of non-existent tritium mines. On Mars, yet. The richer they are, the easier they bite.<br>Martin Humphries was probably the richest person in the solar system, founder and chief of Humphries Space Systems, and well-known to be a prime S.O.B. I&#x2019;d never try to scam him. If he bit on my bait, it could be fatal. So that&#x2019;s why she looks so miserable, I thought. Married to him. I felt sorry for Amanda Cunningham Humphries.<br>But sorry or not, this could be the break I&#x2019;d been waiting for. Amanda Cunningham Humphries was the wife of the richest sumbitch in the solar system. She could buy anything she wanted, including Sam&#x2019;s whole ramshackle company, which was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. As usual. Yet she was asking Sam for help, like a lady in distress. She was scared.<br>&#x201c;Martin Humphries,&#x201d; Sam repeated.<br>She nodded wordlessly. She certainly did not look happy about being married to Martin Humphries.<br>Sam swallowed visibly, his Adam&#x2019;s apple bobbing up and down twice. Then he got to his feet again and said, as brightly as he could manage, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we discuss this over lunch?&#x201d;<br>Sam&#x2019;s office in those days was on the L-5 habitat <i>Beethoven</i>. Funny name for a space structure that housed some fifty thousand people, I know. It was built by a consortium of American, European, Russian, and Japanese corporations. The only name they could agree on was Beethoven&#x2019;s, thanks to the fact that the head of Yamagata Corp. had always wanted to be a symphony orchestra conductor.<br>To his credit, Sam&#x2019;s office was not grand or imposing. He said he didn&#x2019;t want to waste his money on furniture or real estate. Not that he had any money to waste, at the time. The suite was compact, tastefully decorated, with wall screens that showed idyllic scenes of woods and waterfalls. Sam had a sort of picture gallery on the wall behind his desk, S. Gunn with the great and powerful figures of the day&#x2014;most of whom were out to sue him, if not have him murdered&#x2014;plus several photos of Sam with various beauties in revealing attire.<br>I, as his &#x201c;special consultant and advisor,&#x201d; sat off to one side of his teak-and-chrome desk, where I could swivel from Sam to his visitor and back again.<br>Amanda Humphries shook her lovely head. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go out to lunch with you, Mr. Gunn. I shouldn&#x2019;t be seen in public with you.&#x201d;<br>Before Sam could react to that, she added, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing personal. It&#x2019;s just...I don&#x2019;t want my husband to know that I&#x2019;ve turned to you.&#x201d;<br>Undeterred, Sam put on a lopsided grin and said, &#x201c;Well, we could have lunch sent in here.&#x201d; He turned to me. &#x201c;Gar, why don&#x2019;t you rustle us up some grub?&#x201d;<br>I made a smile at his sudden Western folksiness. Sam was a con man, and everybody knew it. That made it all the easier for me to con him. I&#x2019;m a scam artist, myself, par excellence, and it ain&#x2019;t bragging if you can do it. Still, I&#x2019;d been very roundabout in approaching Sam. Conning a con man takes some finesse, let me tell you.<br>About a year ago I talked myself into a job with the Honorable Jill Myers, former U.S. senator and American representative on the International Court of Justice. Judge Myers was an old, old friend of Sam&#x2019;s, dating back to the early days when they&#x2019;d both been astronauts working for the old NASA.<br>I had passed myself off to Myers&#x2019;s people as Garret G. Garrison III, the penniless son of one of the oldest families in Texas. I had doctored up a biography and a dozen or so phony news media reports. With just a bit of money in the right hands, when Myers&#x2019;s people checked me out in the various web nets, there was enough in place to convince them that I was poor but bright, talented, and honest.<br>Three out of four ain&#x2019;t bad. I was certainly poor, bright, and talented.<br>Jill Myers wanted to marry Sam. Why, I&#x2019;ll never figure out. Sam was&#x2014;is!&#x2014;a philandering, womanizing, skirt-chasing bundle of testosterone who falls in love the way Pavlov&#x2019;s dogs salivated when they heard a bell ring. But Jill Myers wanted to marry the little scoundrel, and Sam had even proposed to her&#x2014;once he ran out of all the other sources of funding that he could think of. Did I mention that Judge Myers comes from Old Money? She does: the kind of New England family that still has the first nickel they made in the molasses-for-rum-for-slaves triangle trade back in precolonial days.<br>Anyway, I had sweet-talked my way into Judge Myers&#x2019;s confidence (and worked damned hard for her, too, I might add). So when they set a date for the wedding, she asked me to join Sam&#x2019;s staff and keep an eye on him. She didn&#x2019;t want him to disappear and leave her standing at the altar.<br>Sam took me in without a qualm, gave me the title of &#x201c;special consultant and advisor to the CEO,&#x201d; and put me in the office next to his. He knew I was Justice Myers&#x2019;s enforcer, but it didn&#x2019;t seem to bother him a bit.<br>Sam and I got along beautifully, like kindred souls, really. Once I told him the long, sad (and totally false) story of my life, he took to me like a big brother.<br>&#x201c;Gar,&#x201d; he told me more than once, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re two of a kind. Always trying to get out from under the big guys.&#x201d;<br>I agreed fervently.<br>I&#x2019;ve been a grifter all my life, ever since I sweet-talked Sister Agonista into overlooking the fact that she caught me cheating on the year-end exams in sixth grade. It was a neat scam for an eleven-year-old: I let her catch me, I let her think she had scared me onto the path of righteousness, and she was so happy about it that she never tumbled to the fact that I had sold answer sheets to half the kids in the school.<br>Anyway, life was always kind of rough-and-tumble for me. You hit it big here, and the next time you barely get out with the hide on your back. I had been at it long enough so that by now I was slowing down, getting a little tired, looking for the one big score that would let me wrap it all up and live the rest of my life in ill-gotten ease. I knew Sam Gunn was the con man&#x2019;s con man: The little rogue had made more fortunes than the New York Stock Exchange&#x2014;and lost them just as quickly as he could go chasing after some new rainbow. I figured that if I cozied up real close to Sam I could snatch his next pot of gold before he had a chance to piss it away.<br>So when Judge Myers asked me to keep an eye on Sam I went out to the <i>Beethoven</i> habitat that same day, alert and ready for my big chance to nail the last and best score.<br>Amanda Cunningham Humphries might just be that opportunity, I realized.<br>So now I&#x2019;m bringing a tray of lunch in for Sam and Mrs. Humphries, setting it all out on Sam&#x2019;s desk while they chatted, and then retreating to my own little office so they could talk in privacy.<br>Privacy, hah! I slipped the acoustic amplifier out of my desk drawer and stuck it on the wall that my office shared with Sam&#x2019;s. Once I had wormed the earplug in, I could hear everything they said.<br>Which wasn&#x2019;t all that much. Mrs. Humphries was very guarded about it all.<br>&#x201c;I have a coded video chip that I want you to deliver to my ex-husband,&#x201d; she told Sam.<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but you could have a courier service make the delivery, even out to the Belt. I don&#x2019;t see why&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My ex-husband is Lars Fuchs.&#x201d;<br>Bingo! I don&#x2019;t know how Sam reacted to that news but I nearly jumped out of my chair to turn a somersault. Her first husband was Lars Fuchs! Fuchs the pirate. Fuchs the renegade. Fuchs and Humphries had fought a minor war out there in the Belt a few years earlier. It had ended when Humphries&#x2019;s mercenaries had finally captured Fuchs and the people of Ceres had exiled him for life.<br>For years now Fuchs had wandered through the Belt, an exile eking out a living as a miner, a rock rat. Making a legend of himself. The Flying Dutchman of the Asteroid Belt.<br>It must have been right after he was exiled, I guessed, that Amanda Cunningham had divorced Fuchs and married his bitter rival, Humphries. I later found out that I was right. That&#x2019;s exactly what had happened. But with a twist. She divorced Fuchs and married Humphries on the condition that Humphries would stop trying to track Fuchs down and have him killed. Exile was punishment enough, she convinced Humphries. But the price for that tender mercy was her body. From the haunted look of her, maybe the price included her soul.<br>Now she wanted to send a message to her ex. Why? What was in the message? Humphries would pay a small fortune to find out. No, I decided; he&#x2019;d pay a <i>large</i> fortune. To me.<br>* * *<br>Mrs. Humphries didn&#x2019;t have all that much more to say and she left the office immediately after they finished their lunch, bundled once more into that shapeless black coat with its hood pulled up to hide her face.<br>I bounced back into Sam&#x2019;s office. He was sitting back in his chair, the expression on his face somewhere between exalted and terrified.<br>&#x201c;She needs my help,&#x201d; Sam murmured, as if talking in his sleep.<br>&#x201c;Our help,&#x201d; I corrected.<br>Sam blinked, shook himself, and sat up erect. He nodded and grinned at me. &#x201c;I knew I could count on you, Gar.&#x201d;<br>Then I remembered that I was supposed to be working for Judge Myers.<br>* * *<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s going out to the Belt?&#x201d; Judge Myers&#x2019;s chestnut-brown eyes snapped at me. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re letting him do it?&#x201d;<br>Some people called Jill Myers plain, or even unattractive (behind her back, of course), but I always thought of her as kind of cute. In a way, she looked almost like Sam&#x2019;s sister might: Her face was round as a pie, with a stubby little nose and a sprinkling of freckles. Her hair was light brown and straight as can be; she kept it in a short, no-nonsense bob and refused to let stylists fancy it up for her.<br>Her image in my desk screen clearly showed, though, that she was angry. Not at Sam. At me.<br>&#x201c;Garrison, I sent you to keep that little so-and-so on track for our wedding, and now you&#x2019;re going out to the Belt with him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll only be for a few days,&#x201d; I said. Truthfully, that&#x2019;s all I expected at that point.<br>Her anger abated a skosh; suspicion replaced it.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this all about, Gar?&#x201d;<br>If I told her that Sam had gone bonkers over Amanda Humphries she&#x2019;d be up at <i>Beethoven</i> on the next shuttle, so I temporized a little.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s looking into a new business opportunity at Ceres. It should only take a few days.&#x201d;<br>Fusion torch ships could zip out to the Belt at a constant acceleration. They cost an arm and two legs, but Sam was in his &#x201c;spare no expenses&#x201d; mode, and I agreed with him. We could zip out to the Belt in four days, deliver the message, and be home again in time for the wedding. We&#x2019;d even have a day or so to spare, I thought.<br>One thing about Judge Myers: She couldn&#x2019;t stay angry for more than a few minutes at a time. But from the expression on her face, she remained highly suspicious.<br>&#x201c;I want a call from you every day, Gar,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I know you can&#x2019;t keep Sam on a leash; nobody can. But I want to know where you are and what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. Of course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Every day.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d;<br>Easier said than done.<br>* * *<br>Sam rented a torch ship, the smallest he could find, just a set of fusion engines and propellant tanks with a crew pod attached.

This series will collect the important work of writers who have served as major influences upon and contributors to the cultural and psychic milieu from which North Atlantic evolved.<br><br>A distinguished figure of American letters, whose work and spirit have bridged five decades of creativity, Gerrit Lansing provides a perfect launch for the series with this collected edition of his poetry, which astonishes by the variety of its poetic forms and concerns, lyrical and cosmological. It cannot easily be fitted into niches currently fashionable. Like a "seed growing secretly" (to quote a favorite poet of his, Henry Vaughan), it has influenced the American cultural underground since the late 1950s. Lansing was a friend and associate of generations of creative minds as diverse as the poet Charles Olson and the legendary filmmaker Harry Smith. Poet Robert Kelly notes that "he is the most learned among us, and the most fun."<br><br>Lansing has patiently fashioned a body of work that ranges from short poems such as "The Heavenly Tree Grows Downward" and "In Northern Earth," from which this collection takes its title, to longer cycles like the alchemical serial poem "The Soluble Forest." With themes at once personal and social, erotic and esoteric, <i>Heavenly Tree, Northern Earth </i>manifests the creative spirit of one of the important unheralded masters of modern poetry.</p><p>Gerrit Lansing was born in Albany, New York, in 1928, and grew up in Northern Ohio. Educated at Harvard and Columbia Universities, he has taught at Bard College. For many years Lansing has lived in Gloucester, Massachusetts. In the early 1960s, Lansing edited and published two issues of <i>SET, </i>a literary journal that fused Modernist poetic experiment with occult and spiritual themes and served as a precursor of and influence upon the subsequent counterculture. In 2003, Pressed Wafer published <i>A February Sheaf, </i>collecting his essays and criticism.</p><h2>The River of Shadows (Chathrand Voyage)</h2><p>In the gripping sequel to Robert V. S. Redick&#x2019;s acclaimed epic fantasy novels <i>The Red Wolf Conspiracy</i> and <i>The Ruling Sea,</i> the crew of the vast, ancient ship <i>Chathrand</i> have reached the shores of the legendary southern empire of Bali Adro. Many have died in the crossing, and the alliance of rebels, led by the tarboy Pazel Pathkendle and the warrior Thasha Isiq, has faced death, betrayal, and darkest magic. But nothing has prepared them for the radically altered face of humanity in the South.<br> <br>They have little time to recover from the shock, however. For with landfall, the battle between the rebels and centuries-old sorcerer Arunis enters its final phase. At stake is control of the Nilstone, a cursed relic that promises unlimited power to whoever unlocks the secrets of its use&#x2014;but death to those who fail. And no one is closer to mastering the Stone than Arunis.<br> <br>Desperate to stop him, Pazel and Thasha must join forces with their enemies, including the depraved Captain Rose and the imperial assassin Sandor Ott. But when a suspicious young crewmember turns his attentions to Thasha, it is the young lovers themselves who are divided&#x2014;most conveniently for Arunis. As the mage&#x2019;s triumph draws near, the allies face a terrible choice: to break their oaths and run for safety, or to hunt the world&#x2019;s most dangerous sorcerer through the strange and deadly dream kingdom known as the River of Shadows, and to face him a last time among the traps and horrors of his lair.<br> <br>Brimming with high adventure, dark enchantment, and unforgettable characters, <i>The River of Shadows </i>deftly secures Redick&#x2019;s place in the ranks of epic fantasy&#x2019;s most original and enthralling storytellers.</p><p><b>Robert V.

He lives in western Massachusetts.Lost Souls<br> &nbsp;<br> 21 Ilbrin 941<br> 220th day from Etherhorde<br> &nbsp;<br> It might have been a palace window in Etherhorde: round, red-tinted, firelit from within, but it was a living eye set in a wall of sapphire lunging east through a cobalt sea. Beneath the eye, shattered scales, and a wound that gaped long and raw as the opened belly of a bull. Lower still a mouth like a sea-cave, and from it a hot, salt, rancid wind that took the little skiff in a foul embrace.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one moved. The beast had come upon them so quickly that they&#x2019;d not yet even turned the skiff about. The quartermaster tried to squeeze out a command, but no sound came. On the second try he managed a whisper: &#x201c;Lie down. Lie down!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The others obeyed him, curling down against the deck, and the quartermaster, dropping the helm, did the same. The skiff had been tacking neatly across the inlet, but as the monster closed it began to buck and heave like a wild stallion, and they clung to the thwarts and cleats and oarlocks for dear life. The creature had a serpent&#x2019;s body but its head was leonine, maned in shell-encrusted hair, the strands thick as old halyards and shedding tons of seawater as it rose.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thasha Isiq lifted her eyes. It was close enough to touch with a boathook; she could have leaped from the skiff right into that blue-green mane. She felt someone tugging her arm; she heard the quartermaster, whose name was Fiffengurt, begging her not to stare. But she could not look away. The eye blinked, huge and terrible and desperate and sad. She saw chipped fangs and a black torrent of tongue. She saw an iron collar buried in the mane, and a bit like a rusted tree-trunk cutting into the flesh at the back of the mouth. She saw a chain fused to the bit and whipping up out of the foam. All this in a split second: just before the chain struck the hull and jerked the boat half out of the waves and snapped her head sharply back.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the red flash of pain subsided Thasha raised her head again. The waves were smaller, but the boat had sprung a bubbling leak. Frightened curses, desperate looks. Pazel Pathkendle, Thasha&#x2019;s closest friend in the world, was pointing at a spot some twenty yards off the stern. A huge loop of the serpent was rising there, turning like a section of a gigantic waterwheel, each blue-green scale as large as a soldier&#x2019;s breastplate. Farther east another loop broke the surface; and beyond it that terrible head rose again, and the wound flexed and twisted like a second mouth. The beast was heading for the cape across the inlet, with its fishing village and a cluster of rocky islets a few miles offshore. Behind the largest of these the Chathrand stood at anchor, waiting for their return. Thasha could just hear the lookouts starting to howl.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2019;Ent no blary end to that thing!&#x201d; said one of the Turachs, his eyes on the oozing body of the serpent.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Quiet, marine,&#x201d; whispered his commander.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is dropping lower,&#x201d; said the swordsman, Herc�l Stanapeth.<br> &nbsp;<br> So it was: lower, and lower still, until they could no longer see the horizon beneath the loop of flesh. The farther coil was lowering too, and the creature&#x2019;s head was gone from sight. Then Fiffengurt hissed through his teeth. The water around the skiff had begun to boil.<br> &nbsp;<br> They were in the center of a vast school of sharks, trailing the monster like a ribbon of mercury, packed so tight that they jostled one another, flicking spray into the boat. The sharks were slender, man-sized, their dead eyes round as coins. Thasha could feel the thump of each snout against the hull.<br> &nbsp;<br> Their numbers seemed as endless as the monster&#x2019;s length. But eventually the school was past, and at almost the same time the arch of flesh sank out of sight. Nothing remained of the serpent but a trail of foam.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fiffengurt and the soldiers made the sign of the Tree. Mr. Bolutu, the older dl�mu, began a prayer of thanks to Lord Rin. But Pazel rose carefully to his feet. Thasha watched as he shielded his eyes, studying the creature&#x2019;s wake.<br> &nbsp;<br> So little to him, she thought suddenly. A boy barely seventeen, the age she&#x2019;d be in six weeks, dark like any tarboy, and a bit darker yet by blood. Thin arms, fierce eyes. Did he care about her anymore? Did she care about him? Did it mean something, that notion, I care, I love, after yesterday? He might well have despaired. He might hate her casually, as part of hating everything: the new world and the old, the Chathrand and the place she&#x2019;d anchored, the frightened villagers, the savage Gods.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the prayer ended, Sergeant Haddismal, a hugely muscled Turach with skin like boot leather, twisted around to glare at Mr. Fiffengurt.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t believe these eyes,&#x201d; he said, pointing, as though they might have been confused with some other pair. &#x201c;You dropped the tiller, man! What kind of mucking pilot are you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The kind that brought us safe out of the Nelluroq,&#x201d; said Herc�l.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t ask you, Stanapeth, did I?&#x201d; snapped the Turach. &#x201c;But what I will ask, once more, is what in the nine putrid Pits we&#x2019;re doing out here? What did you lot find yesterday that&#x2019;s got you too scared to let the men set foot on land? It has to be something worse than a few more of these fish-eyed abominids.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The pair of dl�mu just looked at him, silver eyes shining against the black, black skin. Their indifference to his abuse only fueled Haddismal&#x2019;s rage. He shouted at Pazel to sit down, and at Mr. Fiffengurt to bail, although the quartermaster was doing so already. Looking again at Herc�l, the sergeant gestured at the mighty ship that was their destination.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just tell me the Gods-damned truth. Eight hundred men goin&#x2019; mad with thirst, and you come back from the village with two little parlor-casks of fresh water, and say that&#x2019;s it, lads, make do till further notice. What do we get by way of explanation? Nothing. Soon my men are on riot duty, though they&#x2019;re so dry themselves they&#x2019;d lick sweat off a pig. What can I tell &#x2019;em? Nothing. And then, just to prove that you&#x2019;re mad as moon dogs, you announce that we&#x2019;re going to take a jaunt over to the empty side of the inlet, so that you can run about in the dunes. What d&#x2019;ye find there? Nothing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be back on the Chathrand by sunset,&#x201d; said Thasha.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sooner,&#x201d; said Fiffengurt, &#x201c;if we get back to rowing, that is.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Haddismal scowled over his shoulder at the western shore, already a mile behind them. &#x201c;Pointless,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Why, it&#x2019;s just a spit of sand! Any fool can see&#x2014;Eh, Muketch! Sit your arse down!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But Pazel, as if he had forgotten the hated nickname, remained standing in the bows. He was looking at the waves around the skiff, and Thasha noticed that they were ragged and oddly churned.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sergeant Haddismal?&#x201d; said Pazel.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sit down! What is it?&#x201d; barked the Turach.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Take off your armor.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The soldier&#x2019;s mouth fell open. He raised a hand broad as a shovel to strike the youth. But the hand stopped in midair, and his lip curled as if with an unwelcome thought. He glanced at the other soldier, who was already unbuckling his hauberk, and it occurred to Thasha that the previous Turach commander had died in the very act of beating Pazel about the head, and then the boat shot skyward like a rock from a sling, and split across the keel, and Thasha was flying, spinning, shards of hull and mast about her as the tail of the diving serpent snapped like a whip and was gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> She caught a glimpse of Pazel, arms crossed to protect his face, crashing back into the sea as through a sheet of glass; then Thasha herself struck, headfirst. She barely slowed: the monster&#x2019;s descent had created a suction that dragged her down, and the cold and terror of sudden darkness nearly made her gasp. But she did not gasp: Thasha was an admiral&#x2019;s daughter, a thojm�l� fighter, a survivor of the Nelluroq crossing. She held her breath and tore at her boots.<br> &nbsp;<br> They were large and came off easily. The woolen coat took longer to escape; by the time she succeeded the water was black and leaden. Somehow she had the clarity of mind to swim sidelong to the downward current. Eight, ten, a dozen aching strokes. Then the current slackened and she aimed for what was left of the sunlight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dark flames, overhead. The sharks were returning. She pushed through them, heedless; all she wanted was air. When at last she broke the surface, the dorsal fins were flowing by her like small gray sails.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her lungs made an ugly croak. There was barely room to tread water among the sharks. She waited for the first bite, cold and angry. But the sharks were dispersing, their collective mind on the serpent and the greater pickings it provided, and not one of them harmed her. On the crest of a wave she saw Pazel, naked to the chest, and Mr. Fiffengurt clinging to a broken plank. She heard Herc�l shout for Haddismal but saw neither man.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her head slipped under again. Her remaining clothes were going to kill her. She clawed at the knot that secured her sailor&#x2019;s breeches, but only managed to tighten it hopelessly. Giving up, she shed her blouse, then tugged off the breeches with brute force. Rising again, she found the shore at a glance and knew she would not drown.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was Ibjen: supporting the younger Turach, who was limp. Thasha kicked toward them, doubting that the boy could swim a mile through swells and breakers with a dying marine. But before she had taken three strokes the other dl�mic man, Bolutu, surfaced on the other side of the Turach and caught his arm. Together they bore the soldier away.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Hundred Days</h2><p><p><strong>Napoleon's return to the throne in Paris, as imagined by the incomparable Joseph Roth.</strong></p><p>The incomparable Joseph Roth imagines Emperor Napoleon's last grab at glory, the hundred days spanning his escape from Elba to his final defeat at Waterloo. This particularly poignant work, set in the first half of 1815 and largely in Paris, is told from two perspectives, that of Napoleon himself and that of the lowly, devoted palace laundress Angelica&#x2015;an unlucky creature who deeply loves him. In <em>The Hundred Days</em>, Roth refracts the deep sorrow of their intertwined fates.</p><p>Roth's signature lyrical elegance and haunting atmospheric details sing in <em>The Hundred Days</em>. "There may be," as James Wood has stated, "no modern writer more able to combine the novelistic and the poetic, to blend lusty, undamaged realism with sparkling powers of metaphor and simile."</p></p><p><p><strong>Joseph Roth</strong> (1894-1939) was the great elegist of the cosmopolitan culture that flourished in the dying days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He published several books and articles before his untimely death at the age of 44. Roth&#x2019;s writing has been admired by J. M. Coetzee, Jeffrey Eugenides, Elie Wiesel, and Nadine Gordimer, among many others.</p><p><strong>Richard Panchyk</strong> has published twenty-three books, including translations of three Joseph Roth novels: <em>The Antichrist, The Hundred Days,</em> and <em>Perlefter</em>.</p>&#x201c;The totality of Joseph Roth's work is no less than a <em>trag�die humaine</em> achieved in the techniques of modern fiction.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nadine Gordimer</strong><br><br>&#x201c;There is a poem on every page of Joseph Roth.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joseph Brodsky</strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is not perhaps the real Napoleon, but it's certainly a remarkable creation that leaps off the page.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jake Kerridge, <em>The Telegraph</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What a marvelous writer!

Banffy&#39;s life as a statesman and author residing in Hungary at the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, during the downfall of the Hapsburg dynasty, is detailed. His life story includes such notable accomplishments as obtaining Hungary&#39;s admission to the League of Nations and organizing the last Hapsburg coronation for King Karl in 1916. Banffy also reflects upon his country&#39;s experiences through World War I, the first socialist republic, and the terrifying communist rule of Bela Kun.</p><p>Count Miklos Banffy (1873-1950) was variously a diplomat, MP and foreign minister in 1921/22 when he signed the peace treaty with the United States and obtained Hungary&#39;s admission to the League of Nations. He was also responsible for organizing the last Habsburg coronation, that of King Karl in 1916.

ROCKEFELLER<br><br>Ive been a boxing fan all my life, and while I've never entered the ring for a world championship bout, preparing to go onstage for a rap concert is probably about as close to that feeling as you can achieve. It's that hyped up, you know what I'm sayin'? A crowd eagerly anticipates your arrival, waiting for the first chord or the ding of the bell to unleash its collective energy. The buzz in the air is so thick, you think the venue is plugged into some mysterious energy<br><br>source. Once onstage or in the ring, you bob and weave, trying to find your<br><br>flow, burning more calories than Martha Stewart working the dials on her stove. The collective outpouring from the crowd washes over the stage/ring, but you're unaware of it because you're so in the zone. Song leads to song like round to round. You need to stay strong and go the distance-but you always keep your<br><br>2eyes open and look for your opening. I'm gonna knock you out. This was the tour in support of my comeback album, Ten, released in 2002 to both commercial success and critical acclaim. I had worked out for years, but I had accomplished more in the previous 6 months than I had in all those other years combined. Back in the day, it was just pushup contests and hitting the heavy bag and maybe going to the gym once a week, basically to hang with the fellas. No dieting, no nutrition-just a down-and-dirty street style of working out to maintain some kind of conditioning. There was absolutely nothing scientific<br><br>about it. One day I was looking in the mirror at my body, and I just wasn't<br><br>happy with what was goin' on. I became fed up with looking at myself that way. If I'm unhappy with something, I don't accept it; I fix it. So I made the decision right then and there that I was going to do everything I could to achieve the best possible shape of my life, without even really knowing what that would look like or feel like. I set my sights on making it happen for this tour. I was determined to take it to the next level, so I asked my personal trainer, Dave "Scooter" Honig, to join the rest of the crew and me on the tour bus. At the time I weighed 223 �ds, and once he was onboard, I told him, "Scooter, I just want to get down to 210 �ds. If we can accomplish that, I'll be ecstatic." Little did I know that we would actually end up building more muscle than I ever dreamed possible, all while burning fat and getting ripped. Next thing I knew, we were hopping off the tour bus in the middle of the desert in New Mexico, 115 degrees outside, watching our ride drive off without us, the bus blurry in the heat. The driver would pull off the road 5 miles ahead of us and wait for me to catch up. On foot. Hot? The bugs couldn't walk, it was so hot. The turtles were taking a rest. Maybe it was the heat coming up off the asphalt, but it felt like I was running in hot grease, my calves were burning so bad. Still, we would do that 2 days a week on the road because we were spending so much time driving from one venue to another. It wasn't just a matter of getting from here to there either. We would clock ourselves and try to improve each time. That's the type of dedication that you must have to succeed at this. What's your highway in the desert? Is it working hard all day and then going home to take care of your family before you can even think about picking up a dumbbell? Your tour is your life. Your tour is work, kids, school, trying out for a team, or whatever. It's different for all of us. For me, it was passing a school, having the driver pull over, and scrambling over the fence for a makeshift workout. I'd run around the track, do pullups off the football goalpost, bang out some pushups in the end zone. It was crazy,<br><br>wasn't it, Scoots? Scooter recalls: "We used supersets. We used pre-exhaust sets. We used straight sets. We used circuits. It all depended on what I thought Todd needed to accomplish on that particular day. I incorporated anything and everything in a concerted effort to confuse his muscles. "We might go from heavy benches to weighted dips and weighted pullups, and then sprint for a minute, followed by stomach crunches. I'd throw intervals into the mix as well. If a treadmill wasn't available, we'd use stepups, or jumping rope, or mountain climbers. That's what we did a lot on the road. "He has to rock 'n' roll onstage, so the goal was to keep his heart rate elevated during his training sessions. We don't always have to do this, but the goal on that tour was to burn as many calories as possible in the shortest amount of time. I'd also break the workouts up. Sometimes we'd do our runs early in the morning, and then later in the day, once it had cooled down, we would do our weight training." 3 Rock Hard When you're training that intensely, you really need to keep an eye on your diet as well. After walking into a diner at 3:30 one morning, Scooter asked the cook to clean the grill off because he didn't want the grease on the grill entering my body. The guy looked at him, thought he was crazy, took a $5 tip, cleaned the grill, and then cooked for us. Other times we would stop at a truck stop in the Deep South, those places where they sell anything from guns and flannel shirts to rebel flags. There was a<br><br>small diner attached to one such truck stop, and here come seven black guys and one little white guy-Scooter-walking in through the door. We sit down and the waitress comes over holding her notepad and missing several teeth. She goes, "What can I do for you fellas?" I said, "We'd like to order, please." She goes, "You've got to wait a minute. I got to go take the money over at the register, and then I've got to just clean those tables." So she buses the tables, handles the money, washes some glasses. Then, without washing her hands, she comes straight back over to us. "Okay, now what can I getcha?" We all look at each other for a few seconds, and then Scooter says, "We'd like to order. Can I please speak to the cook?" She goes, "You're lookin' at her, honey." He says, "Well, ma'am, I'm sorry but you're not cooking our food. Take me to the kitchen. Would you mind if I cook?" She goes, "No." So Scooter went back there and made us egg- white omelets. All the guys went crazy. Scooter: "We would stop on the road, the rest of the crew, from the lighting guys down to the bodyguards, and, boy, can they eat. One of the guys on the bus is the rib king. He would always ask the driver to stop at those rib joints that pop up on the side of the road, the ones where you can see the smoke coming out of the windows from a mile down the road. You think fire trucks are coming there, only they're just cooking ribs in a tin barrel. Anyway, this guy had a built-in homing device for those joints, and as soon as we stopped, Todd would look at me, and I would look at him and say, 'You're not eating it.' Every time, the rib king would have a sour stomach." Even at five-star hotels, Scooter would go in the back and ask the chefs to<br><br>please cook his way. It was hilarious: At the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, they had Scooter's Menu on the wall for Mr. Todd Smith. It was crazy. LL'S MUSCLE-BUILDING TIP It doesn't really matter when you lift during the day just so long as you lift. Testosterone levels are naturally highest in the morning, which might give you a little more intensity. At night the weights might boost your metabolism at a time when it normally slows down. Either way, these differences are negligible and tend to cancel each other out. Train whenever it best fits your schedule. Scooter: "After the show, whether we trained would depend where we were that day and how long of a ride we'd have to the next town. Because Todd needs to sleep. So I figured, since he's up, and it's 12:30, we'd get a bite to eat, and then we'd get our workout in. That way he'd have more time to sleep. When you're on the road, it's very important for your client to sleep because he's performing and there's a lot 4of traveling involved. So what we'd usually do was, he would sleep, get up and eat, we'd train, he'd go back, lie down, relax-and then we'd go to the show. All the meals would be sent to his room. "That was the easy part. If we were on the bus, we couldn't stop because we had to reach the next gig, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. You have 8 hours to get from Point A to Point B. So I'd have to serve food on the bus. And I would be cooking chicken breasts, smoking up the cabin-the guys would go crazy. I was the king of tuna. Everybody wanted me to make Scooter's Tuna Special for them, with mayo, sliced tomatoes, a little lemon-lime juice, a little pepper, and a little celery. I would mix that all together and make a nice platter-and everybody<br><br>would enjoy that. That was the Scooter Meal." SCOOTER'S FAT-LOSS TIP If you eat until you're full, you've lost the battle. Always leave the dinner table with a desire to consume more food-but the discipline and foresight to get up and leave. The Man in the Mirror In the middle of that tour came the moment of truth: We had gotten the single "Luv U Better" heated up on the radio, and it was time to shoot the video. I was doing some barbell rows a day or two before the cameras were to roll, and I<br><br>looked up at the mirror, and all of a sudden I saw the form. I saw it! I said, "Yo, this is real." I saw the shape, I saw the cuts, and I was like, "This is crazy." I had never really noticed it before, but all of a sudden, I just saw it. I was like, "Wow-this thing is really working!" You're probably wondering how I could have sustained such an intense training regimen and gotten in shape for a video in the middle of a concert tour. It<br><br>sounds crazy, I know. But through years of training fighters and other world-class athletes, Scooter has developed a unique knack for pushing the human body just far enough to make it respond without pushing it over the edge. See, boxers have to build some serious body armor-muscle-and then maintain it while they systematically develop enough endurance to go the distance. That balance between muscularity and conditioning is a delicate one to achieve, and never more so than when he takes a client like me out on the road. If I catch a cold on tour and cancel a date, a lot of money is at stake for many people, including the promoter, let alone thousands of disappointed fans. Scooter knows exactly how far he can push me, just as he knows exactly how far we can push you in the Platinum Workout. I may look like a pro athlete, but at the end of the day, I'm an artist and a businessman. I'm not looking to enter a World's Strongest Man contest. I'm looking to build an aesthetic body that can blow people away onstage, on- screen, or in a video. I don't have to prove how strong I am; I need to present a certain look. And when I'm performing, I need to be in good enough cardiovascular shape to move like an uncaged lion and sing at the same time. Scooter: "After a while, you can read your client not only motivationally, to see if burnout is approaching, but also by monitoring his strength levels and his heart rate to see if he's overtraining. If LL was overtraining, he would tell me, 'Scooter, I'm beat. It's over. It's a wrap. Go relax.' Occasionally there would be stretches where we wouldn't work out for 2 or 3 days because he would be very tired. It's just not productive to train in that state. 5 "The goal is to keep the client very strong, and I do that by balancing food, supplementation, and rest along with working out. It's a very hard process to figure out for each individual, and I can't predict what all of your unique</p><h2>Romancing: The Life and Work of Henry Green</h2><p>Henry Green led a double life. As Henry Yorke, a descendant of the earl of Hardwicke and Baron Leconfield, he was a wealthy aristocrat, with a family fortune and an engineering plant in the British Midlands. As Henry Green (the pseudonym he settled on after trying out Henry Browne), he wrote nine of our century's most original novels, including Living, Party Going, Caught, and Loving all of which, with daringly experimental techniques, capture the psychological truths of ordinary life in dramatic, sometimes poignant, and often hilarious ways. Green also formed friendships and rivalries with many of his time's leading literary figures, including Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell, Eudora Welty and Terry Southern. And he led an extravagantly messy personal life.<br><br>Jeremy Treglown, the highly praised biographer of Roald Dahl, discusses Green's novels in close connection with his life his unusual camaraderie with factory workers, his sympathy for servants, his ambivalence about his peers, his drinking, and his extramarital affairs. Treglown also shows how Green's portrayal of everyday uncertainties mirrored his efforts to understand his weaknesses and the chaotic conduct of his life efforts whose literary results, John Updike has said, bring the rectangle of the printed page alive like little else in English fiction of this century.<br></p><p>"Shrewd, sparkling, and compulsively readable."<br>Humphrey Carpenter, <i>London Sunday Times</i>Jeremy Treglown has published six books, including Roald Dahl: A Biography, and has written for The New Yorker and Grand Street.

Asking McClure who his friends were, Kennan was astounded when he listed the names that included Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, Bruce Conner, Neal Cassady, and Ken Kesey. He had studied the works of these groundbreaking poets, writers, and artists, and recognized the significance of this opportunity.</p><p>Twenty-one years old, Keenan spent over a year documenting the last days of the Beat Generation with a borrowed 35mm camera, photographing the Beats in their homes and with their families and friends. His portraits constitute a unique chronology and reportage of this era, and many of these photos have since become iconic images that represent a literary generation. Here, in this book of 20 postcards, is a timeless rendering of the spirit of the Beats.</p><p>"This slim volume produced by City Lights Publishers offers the reader a taste of Keenan&#x2019;s astounding work in post-card-sized bites: Especially riveting are the shots of Bob Dylan, Michael McClure and Allen Ginsberg taken in the alley behind City Lights Bookstore in 1965, before Dylan&#x2019;s San Francisco show with Robbie Robertson and The Hawks. Also of note is the shot of Neal Cassady in front of the mirror shaving, and the wonderful photo of the late Allen Ginsberg sharing a private moment with Dennis Hopper. Keenan&#x2019;s work, always pristine and often over-looked, provides a personal glimpse into the magical cool and troubled heart of the 1960s."

She is the author of <i>The Ageless Self </i>and <i>The Healer&#x2019;s Tale</i>.</p>Starred Review. This beautifully synthesized and disquieting account of how hospital patients die melds disciplined description with acute analysis, incorporating the voices of doctors, nurses, social workers and patients in a provocative analysis of the modern American quest for "a good death." In a series of case studies, Kaufman (<i>The Ageless Self: Sources of Meaning in Life</i>), a professor of medical anthropology at UC&#x2013;San Francisco, shows how hospitals, by focusing on life-saving treatments, can indefinitely prolong the life of the critically ill patient, who may drift into an indeterminate zone, suspended between life and death. "[D]ying has become a technical endeavor, a negotiated decision and a murky matter biologically," she notes. Writing with penetrating clarity and detached compassion, and with respect for hospital staff and families alike, Kaufman reveals the dilemmas of hospital death in America today: the shift to patients' control of decision making despite the doctors' greater knowledge; the ethics and practical effects of resuscitation versus pain relief; the complexities of assessing "quality of life" while guessing at the desires of an unconscious patient. Kaufman's unwavering account reveals a culture of clinical practice that seems to have trouble acknowledging the inevitability of death, and that moves awkwardly from curative to palliative treatment. This deeply probing study lays bare the cultural and institutional assumptions and rhetoric that frame our search for "a good death." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But after befriending and tricking one of the officers, Hubbard makes an audacious escape. Inspector Marmion, the detective who arrested Hubbard, is warned to watch his back, but it seems that Hubbard has another target in his murderous sights. However, the investigation is mired in confusion, the identities of killer and victim become increasingly ambiguous. An inmate at an internment camp who might be a spy sending intelligence to the Germans complicates matters further, and the multiplying manhunts, as well as Marmion&#x2019;s concern for his injured and withdrawn son Paul, leave the detective desperate and perhaps with too many threads to untangle.</p><p>Edward Marston has written over a hundred books, including some non fiction. He is best known for his hugely successful Railway Detective series.

Crime goes on, despite the wholesale carnage in Europe, and the portrayal of policing in the period is almost refreshing. The plotline is very well paced, as expected from a prolific author. The characters are three-dimensional and believable and behave in perfectly understandable ways." (<i>Historical Novels Review</i>)</p><h2>The Politics of Resentment: A Genealogy</h2><p><p>In the days and weeks following the tragic 2011 shooting of nineteen Arizonans, including congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, there were a number of public discussions about the role that rhetoric might have played in this horrific event. In question was the use of violent and hateful rhetoric that has come to dominate American political discourse on television, on the radio, and at the podium. A number of more recent school shootings have given this debate a renewed sense of urgency, as have the continued use of violent metaphors in public address and the dishonorable state of America&#x2019;s partisan gridlock. This conversation, unfortunately, has been complicated by a collective cultural numbness to violence. But that does not mean that fruitful conversations should not continue. In <em>The Politics of Resentment</em>, Jeremy Engels picks up this thread, examining the costs of violent political rhetoric for our society and the future of democracy.</p><p><em>The Politics of Resentment</em> traces the rise of especially violent rhetoric in American public discourse by investigating key events in American history. Engels analyzes how resentful rhetoric has long been used by public figures in order to achieve political ends. He goes on to show how a more devastating form of resentment started in the 1960s, dividing Americans on issues of structural inequalities and foreign policy. He discusses, for example, the rhetorical and political contexts that have made the mobilization of groups such as Nixon&#x2019;s &#x201c;silent majority&#x201d; and the present Tea Party possible. Now, in an age of recession and sequestration, many Americans believe that they have been given a raw deal and experience feelings of injustice in reaction to events beyond individual control. With <em>The Politics of Resentment</em>, Engels wants to make these feelings of victimhood politically productive by challenging the toxic rhetoric that takes us there, by defusing it, and by enabling citizens to have the kinds of conversations we need to have in order to fight for life, liberty, and equality.</p></p><p><p>Jeremy Engels is Associate Professor of Communication Arts and Sciences at The Pennsylvania State University.</p>&#x201c;What is the relationship between rhetoric and violence? Jeremy Engels addresses that question in the aftermath of the 2011 shooting spree that seriously wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed several others. Drawing on wide-ranging scholarship in political theory and American public discourse, he argues that political elites hijack justified popular resentment against oppressive social systems and redirect it against powerless individuals, thereby creating the potential for violence. Provocative in its understanding of democracy, compelling in its case studies of Richard Nixon and Sarah Palin, and challenging in its call for reinvigorated rhetorical criticism, this is a book that makes us think.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;David Zarefsky, former president of the National Communication Association and of the Rhetoric Society of America<br><br>&#x201c;There may be no more pressing problem in contemporary U.S. political culture than a flourishing politics of resentment, which divides citizens, stalls policy, and excuses injustice. In <i>The Politics of Resentment</i>, Jeremy Engels helps readers understand how resentment has arisen as a political force and how scholars and citizens may respond. Toward these ends, <i>The Politics of Resentment</i> deftly weaves together history, criticism, and theory. Engels argues eloquently that we cannot &#x2018;ban resentment from the public sphere,&#x2019; but he suggests ways to productively turn resentment toward disclosing structural violence, thereby helping achieve justice and promote a public good.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Robert Asen, University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison<br><br>&#x201c;Recommended for scholars of public address and rhetorical theory alike, <i>The Politics of Resentment </i>will soon be required reading for courses on deliberative democracy&#x2014;and deservedly so. With proper exposure, this book may well contribute to the growth of a more peaceful, less resentful nation.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Eric C.

Extra pressure for the first case's resolution comes from a prominent politician who already has an axe to grind with the police. That Challis's relationship with Destry violates police regulations complicates matters. Disher has a gift for terse description (e.g., Challis's boss wore the look of a man who'd been adored but only by his mother and long ago). While the deus ex machina solution to the official's murder may disappoint some, the personal interactions among Challis and his colleagues will quickly engage even newcomers. <i>Author tour.

This book's title refers to the color of the Hulk in his first issue, in 1962. Loeb and Sale tell the story of the 48 hours after Bruce Banner first became the Hulk. They present a slightly revised version of Banner's initial transformation, and most of the rest of the work consists of new sequences set within the time frame of the Hulk's first issue. Inventively, the authors have a present-day Banner narrate this story in a session with psychiatrist Leonard "Doc" Samson. Through their comments, Loeb explores the psychology of the principal characters: Banner and the Hulk; his nemesis, General "Thunderbolt" Ross; Ross's introverted daughter, Betty, who loves Banner; and Banner's teenage confidant, Rick Jones. In doing so, Loeb raises questions about these characters' motivations that, until now, haven't been incisively investigated. Loeb deftly builds on the classic work of the past without making major revisions, reinterpreting it to expose and illuminate its underlying psychological depths. Sale's art blends caricature and realism, explosive action and ominous mood, capturing the spirit of Hulk co-creator Jack Kirby's work while creating an independently quirky style. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Exploring the ways in which trans issues are addressed within feminist and women&#x2019;s organizations and social movements around the world, contributors ask how trans, genderqueer, and nonbinary issues are related to feminist movements today, what kind of work is currently undertaken in the name of trans/feminism, what new paradigms and visions are emerging, and what questions still need to be taken up. Central to this special issue is the recognition that trans/feminist politics cannot restrict itself to the domain of gender alone.</p><p>This issue features numerous shorter works that represent the diversity of trans/feminist practices and problematics and, in addition to original research articles, includes theory, reports, manifestos, opinion pieces, reviews, and creative/artistic productions, as well as republished key documents of trans/feminist history and international scholarship.</p>Contributors: Miriam Abelson, Sara Ahmed, Aitzole Araneta, Alexandre Baril, Marie-H�l�ne/Sam Bourcier, micha c�rdenas<b>,</b> Daniel Ch�vez, Jeanne C�rdova, Pedro J.

And it was during his 1976 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, when he claims he drew more laughter than votes, that James K. Kilpatrick pronounced him "too funny to be President."<br>Udall kept four black notebooks of jokes that he had collected throughout his public life. This book, a memoir of Udall's career, collects many of those jokes to create a citizen's guide to the lighter side of politics.</p><p>A long-time congressman from Arizona, Udall ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1976 and, finishing second in any number of primaries, ultimately lost out to Jimmy Carter. One of the reasons for his defeat, he implies here, may have been his irrepressible sense of humor, and he presents examples of it in this lighthearted autobiography. There is serious information about his life and political career, but the book begins and ends with scores of anecdotes, most of them political, from such diverse sources as Leo Tolstoy and Will Rogers. Some of the most telling stories are credited to Mark Twain, Abe Lincoln and Adlai Stevenson, and almost all of them are trenchant and amusing. The editing is haphazard, however, for several of the jokes are repeated. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Noting that "we live in a country where public figures and a free press can laugh together," Udall writes on the value of wit. Drawing on his upbringing in small-town Arizona and years as a Congressman, this statesman contends that "humor is possibly the most potent tool a politician can wield." He discusses his defeat in the 1979 presidential primaries, his legislative triumphs, and his misguided battle to dam up the Grand Canyon, and encourages public speakers to borrow jokes and stories from his "black notebooks." Contemporary, anecdotal, and highly readable; recommended for those weary of political antics. Kimberly G. Allen, Supreme Court Lib., Washington , D.C.<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Roadworks: Photographs and Words</h2><p>Offers a collection of one hundred and sixty photographs capturing life on the road from the late sixties to the early eighties, from cheering audiences to garish billboards to fleeting landscapes</p><p>Linda McCartney's unassuming eye seems to capture the everyday in a not-so-everyday fashion. Having forged a fine career as a fashion and features photographer before becoming a part of rock 'n' roll history, her sense for stilled urgency comes across in these "personal road movie recording[s]," as she calls the images in this collection. Some photos bring the work of Robert Frank to mind--the quick blurred scene of two girls walking through an urban landscape, for example, and a "hungry" vagabond on a stretch of highway: these come across almost as homages to Frank--and not bad ones, at that. Though this whole book at times seems rather a hodgepodge, the narrative quality of each image holds its own. In both color and black-and-white, McCartney's images, which here span the globe and at least two decades, deserve the attention and study of today's younger generation of photographers. Of course, this book full of them will surely be popular on account of name recognition alone. <i>Raul Nino</i></p><h2>The Mouse Who Ate Bananas</h2><p>After Mouse finishes his bananas, he throws away the peels and watches in amusement as the other animals slip and fall on them.</p><p></p><h2>The Brothers Grimm and Folktale</h2><p>"Some of the best folklore and Grimm scholars from Europe and the U.S. combined to<br> give an excellent overview of the scholarly research and current critical thought regarding<br> Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm and their hugely popular <i>Grimm's Fairy Tales</i>. . . .

What mysteries would they uncover? Where might their journey lead them and would they find the true Grail? The Holy Grail&#x2014;the cup of the Last Supper used to collect the holy blood of Jesus&#x2014;has a darker side than the one known from medieval romance. Extraordinary new evidence about the true origins of this sacred vessel unveils a 2,000-year-old secret teaching passed down from the time of Christ concerning the dual role played in the foundation of the Christian Church by Mary Magdalene and John the Evangelist. These forbidden teachings were suppressed by the Church of Rome, yet they managed to survive as part of an underground stream of knowledge kept alive by the Cathar heretics of the French Languedoc, the Knights Templar, Renaissance painters, and modern occultists such as Aleister Crowley. This gripping personal quest into the cryptic and shadowy world of arcane societies and esoteric knowledge takes the reader on a journey of visions and mystery before culminating in a dramatic conclusion. Herein lies the colorful and passionate story of strange Gnostic sects and the dark side of Catholic history. <i>Twenty-First Century Grail</i> kicks the Grail legend into modern era and redefines its boundaries for a new generation.</p><p>Andrew Collins is the author of<i> Gateway to Atlantis</i> and the coauthor of <i>Tutankhamun: The Exodus Conspiracy</i>.&#34;A highly potent confection and a profoundly compelling study of the Grail Mythos.&#34;</p><h2>MacLean&#39;s Miscellany of Whisky</h2><p>Charles MacLean pours a lifetime&#x2019;s love and knowledge of Scotch whisky into this delightful book.

This groundbreaking work by one of today&#39;s leading theologians offers a major Protestant ecclesiology for the church catholic. This volume, the first of three, considers the priesthood of the church in light of the priesthood of Christ. Tom Greggs shows the connection between Christ&#39;s work as high priest and the universal church&#39;s role in salvation. All together, the three volumes will offer a major statement on the doctrine of the church for Christians from a variety of backgrounds.</p><p>"Tom Greggs is a wise and trusted guide in providing urgently needed reflections on ecclesiology from a Protestant perspective. Wide-ranging and deep, this volume repays careful study and reflection. A remarkable achievement."<br>--<b>L.&nbsp;Gregory Jones</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"There is a great need for a substantial, lively, and wise Protestant theology of the church, and Greggs is producing it. And he gives us even more: a beautiful architecture that works for this first volume and yet is open to the next two; daring, liberating insights and verdicts on major issues; and a profound, prophetic vision of what the church--local, regional, and international--is called to be in the twenty-first century. Whatever denomination you are in, and indeed if you are not attached to any, this is a book in which to immerse yourself and then to take as a companion as you let it shape and inspire your imagination, thought, prayer, and love."<br>--<b>David&nbsp;F. Ford</b>, University of Cambridge<br><br>"Contemporary accounts of the church tend to describe a body either so indistinct from the world as to be indistinguishable from it or so separated as to be sectarian. Neither pattern has been persuasive. Earlier accounts have tended to take either a liturgical approach (the Eucharist makes the church) or one based on polity (personal episcopacy is of the <i>bene esse</i> of the church). These are equally self-favoring. Tom Greggs instead grounds his ecclesiology on the classically understood three offices of Christ--Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King--seeing the church's proclaiming, healing, and sacrificial aspects held together in a series of fractals rather than a set of deductive statements of dogma. It's a work of practice, belief, and passionate vision. Were my father, T.&nbsp;F. Torrance, still alive, I know how delighted he would be."<br>--<b>Iain&nbsp;R. Torrance</b>, president emeritus, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"This is an intellectual tour de force from one of our leading contemporary theologians and will undoubtedly be a lasting reference point for ecclesiology. Greggs develops a distinctively Protestant account of the church that is also thoroughly ecumenical in tone and approach--informed by deep and perceptive readings of Scripture and tradition, consistently focused on the core theological questions, and communicated with clarity and grace. His rigorous attention to what the church <i>is</i>, rather than what the church <i>does</i>, enables him to develop a hospitable ecclesiology that can speak across contexts and traditions."<br>--<b>Rachel Muers</b>, University of LeedsEcclesiology is a key issue for the present age of church history. This groundbreaking work by one of today's leading theologians offers a major Protestant ecclesiology for the church catholic. This volume, the first of three, considers the priesthood of the church in light of the priesthood of Christ, showing the connection between Christ's work as high priest and the universal church's role in salvation. Volume&nbsp;2 will explore the prophetic apostolicity of the church, and volume&nbsp;3 will cover the kingly holiness of the church.<br><b><br></b>"Tom Greggs has produced one of the most substantial accounts of the church in recent times. In offering a theologically rich ecclesiology, he nevertheless remains alert to the complexity of Christian communities in their different forms and styles. While deeply influenced by Protestant theology, Greggs describes a church that is properly catholic, ecumenical, and extrovert in its relation to the world. The first in a trilogy, this volume will shape future discussion."<br>--<b>David Fergusson</b>, University of Edinburgh<br><br>"Tom Greggs refuses the temptation to make ecclesiology about the usual second-order things of polity and institution. He offers instead a resoundingly theological account of the place of the church within the work of God. Clear-eyed about the state we are in, he renders more exciting an understanding of what the Holy Spirit is doing in creating a church. The result is a timely contribution to the church, which is (as he reminds us) a priestly church, a church for the world. This is a truly exhilarating read, with many 'Ah, of course' moments, a generosity towards his sources, and a searing clarity of argument. It brings so much to the ecumenical table, of the very fullest expression of church."<br>--<b>Susan Durber</b>, moderator of the World Council of Churches' Commission on Faith and Order</p><h2>Treadmill to Oblivion: My Days in Radio</h2><p>Fans of classic comedy and Old Time Radio will be enthralled by Fred Allen&#39;s autobiographical tale of his early days in radio.

This book is the first comprehensive monograph of Rothenberg&#39;s work, offering the reader a broad view of both her paintings and her life. Born in upstate New York, Rothenberg spent her early years studying art and dance before moving to Manhattan for college. There, she became involved in the conceptually oriented art world of 1960s New York City. As Rothenberg began to individuate herself and her work from that movement, her canvases became one of the forces that reinvigorated American painting in the 1970s. Rothenberg later headed to the Southwest, inspiring the incorporation of themes culled from her desert environment into her continually evolving painting style. This volume is filled with excellent reproductions of her work, accompanied by Rothenberg&#39;s own comments about her ideas and inspirations that provide excellent insight into both her work and her character.</p><h2>Stained Glass in an Afternoon</h2><p>Not only are the techniques for both copper foil and mosaic stained glass completely demystified here, but all 25 projects take only an afternoon to complete.

When he happened upon her one day, a relationship was formed which swiftly convinced him of their mutual love. But Castel&#39;s growing paranoia would lead him to destroy the one thing he truly cared about...Sabato&#39;s first novel &#34;El Tunel&#34; (translated as &#34;The Outsider&#34; or &#34;The Tunnel&#34;), written in 1948, is framed as the confession of the painter Juan Pablo Castel, who has murdered the only woman capable of understanding him. Sabato&#39;s novels were praised by authors such as Albert Camus and Graham Greene.</p><p>Ernesto Sabato was born in Argentina in 1911. He earned a PhD in physics before relocating to Paris. After World War II, he lost faith in science and began writing fiction, although he would burn much of his work. His three published novels are The Tunnel (1948), his masterpiece On Heroes and Tombs (1961) and The Angel of Darkness (1974). He also led the commission investigating those who disappeared during Argentina&#39;s Dirty War of the 1970s. Sabato died in 2011, two months before his 100th birthday.Text: English, Spanish (translation)</p><h2>Human Problems and How To Solve Them</h2><p>YOU CAN BE AS HAPPY AS YOU WANT TO BE.

In the first unit, Interpretation Book Clubs: Analysing Themes, students draw on a repertoire of ways for reading closely, noticing how story elements interact, understanding how different authors develop the same theme, and comparing and contrasting texts that develop a similar theme. In the second unit, Tackling Complexity: Moving Up Levels of Nonfiction, children investigate the ways nonfiction texts are becoming more complex, and they learn strategies to tackle these new challenges. This unit emphasises the strong foundational skills, such as fluency, orienting to texts, and word solving, that are required to read complex nonfiction. In the third unit, Argument and Advocacy: Researching Debatable Issues, students read complex nonfiction texts to conduct research on a debatable topic, consider perspective and craft, evaluate arguments, and formulate their own evidence-based, ethical positions on issues. In the final unit for fifth grade, Fantasy Book Clubs: The Magic of Themes and Symbols, students work in clubs to become deeply immersed in the fantasy genre and further develop higher-level thinking skills to study how authors develop characters and themes over time.

The spectacular bi-level church built in his memory on the side of a mountain in Assisi is full of frescoes by Giotto, Cimabue, Lorenzetti and Simone Martini that illustrate scenes from his life and from the Bible. With many full-color photographs, including details and full-page illustrations, this book provides complete documentation of the history and decorative program of the Basilica.</p><p>Italian scholar Lunghi provides a chronologically organized overview of the basilica of St. Francis in Assisi from its inception to the completion of its many wall decorations. Offering the most complete mural decoration of the 13th and 14th centuries found in Italy, the church represents at once the culmination of medieval culture and the dawn of the Renaissance art. Scholastic, Byzantine, and humanistic at the same time, the building gathers elements of French Gothic architecture, rare in Italy, and reasserts ancient Roman fresco painting within a great social dynamic. Works by then-revolutionary Florentine artists Cimabuc and Giotto, as well as the Sienese Lorenzetti and Simone Martini, are offered here in 232 high-quality color reproductions, many showing enlarged details in full-page placements. Luciano Bellosi's Giotto and Cecilia Jannella's Simone Martini, two books currently available in the publisher's resonably priced "Library of Great Masters," would complement this title.

Astonishing long out of print memoir from a man whose life the whole word should remember. General Moravec had the rare distinction of fighting and risking his life to free his country from not one but three empires (Austro-Hungary, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia). His tales of starting the Czech intelligence service from scratch and eventually leading it into exile are hair raising real life thriller stuff.

Buildings fell, fires flared, and the city burned for several days. This is the stirring story of one Chinese American family who had to leave their home in Chinatown on that early morning to join hundreds of other refugees making their way to safety.</p><p>Dr. Short is a division director at the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL) in Washington, D.C. She has worked as a teacher, trainer, researcher, and curriculum/materials developer. Her work at CAL has concentrated on the integration of language learning with content-area instruction. Through several national projects, she has conducted research and provided professional development and technical assistance to local and state education agencies across the United States. She directed the ESL Standards and Assessment Project for TESOL and co-developed the SIOP model for sheltered instruction.<br><br> Dr. Short's monographs include: Extend Your Students' Reach and Move Them Toward Independence, Base Your ESL Instruction in the Content Areas, Reach for the Common Core, Structural Supports for English Learners, Comprehensive and Responsive Assessment, and Developing Academic Literacy in Adolescents.K-Gr 2-This narrative follows a child and her family from their severely damaged home in Chinatown to the relative safety of Golden Gate Park on the day of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Unfortunately, most of the dramatic tension such a day would engender has been lost in overly cautious prose. The concluding author's note is far more interesting. It contains fascinating details (the mother and grandmother had bound feet, which hindered their progress to safety) and factual information (the original death count excluded women and children, Native Americans, African Americans, and Japanese and Chinese immigrants because they were not on the books as voters or property owners). Illustrations utilize a somber palette of browns and grays. The buildings of the city will be disappointing to readers who are familiar with San Francisco because they lack the distinctive and recognizable style of the city's architecture. Named sites, such as Portsmouth Square, lack identifying characteristics, rendering the art generic rather than site specific. Even the figures seem generic, devoid of individual personalities. Although this story is based on the author's mother's experience, it lacks the spark of life.<p></p><p><i>Dorian Chong, School of Library and Information Science, San Jose State University, CA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Riders of the Purple Sage</h2><p>Riders of the Purple Sage is a classic of the Western genre.

She was original, passionate, vivid, dedicated to her art. Yet most biographies of her still revolve around her social life and the Bloomsbury set.<br><br>In this fresh, absorbing book, Julia Briggs puts the writing back at the center of the life. Working closely with diaries, letters and original manuscripts, Briggs has created a masterly study of Woolf's writing process, the finished works, and their reception in the wider world. From The Voyage Out (1915) to Between the Acts (1941), Briggs traces the creation of Woolf's major novels and explores the contradictions that recur in her life and her work: her critique of marriage as a hopelessly patriarchal institution along with her enduring, if essentially platonic, devotion to her husband; her need for solitude and contemplation along with the social skills and ambitions that would make her part of the legend of Bloomsbury; her loathing of patriotism and her love of England, its landscapes and literature; her natural reserve and her deep conviction that women need to speak more openly of their bodies and their sexuality. Using Woolf's own matchless commentary on the creative process, Julia Briggs has produced a book which is a convincing, moving portrait of an artist at full stretch, but also a brilliant meditation on the whole nature of creativity.<br><br>Virginia Woolf: An Inner Life-a profound new insight into a literary genius.<br></p><h2>Republic of Caste</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Do Parents Matter?: Why Japanese Babies Sleep Soundly, Mexican Siblings Don t Fight, and American Families Should Just Relax</h2><p><b>When it comes to parenting, more isn't always better-but it is always more tiring</b><br><br>In Japan, a boy sleeps in his parents' bed until age ten, but still shows independence in all other areas of his life.

You won't find any easy answers or quick career fixes in <i>What Can You Do with a Law Degree?</i> What you will get is a pragmatic approach to career development, and a multitude of career-building techniques, that have been successfully tested by thousands of lawyers and law students. You may be facing unemployment or retirement, or graduating from law school with no clear career path ahead of you.

You may be restless and bored, hate your job or your work, feel underpaid or unappreciated, or be too burned out to drag yourself to the office each morning.

You're analytical, intelligent, motivated, responsible, the kind of person who achieves the goals you set for yourself. And that's the key.

The objects have a clarity that lift them off the page and make them seem three dimensional. The color paintings glow, and the details of the brush strokes are vivid. The incisive snippets of text equal the graphics. Personal belongings and artists' tools are photographed sharply: eye glasses, correspondence, photographs of relatives, palettes, brushes, and easels. A few photographs of the landscapes are shown for comparison to the canvasses, which are documented in stages from initial sketches to completed works. Several works in each volume are analyzed by closeups of the individual strokes, discussions of organizing principles of the paintings, and a breakdown of the pigments applied. Knowledgeable art enthusiasts will relish the intimacy of the visuals and the lucid writing that lightly touches upon the critical aspects of the works. Novices will hopefully be smitten by these sparkling gems of insight and be inspired to read further. Perspective has the broadest range, documenting four centuries of the scientific study and interpretation of the subject. The 27 mini-chapters have the character of an erudite illustrated dictionary of exceptional focus. Each volume has a location of works on exhibit section.

Whether it was an anti-Vietnam march or the Cyber Valley of Seattle, <i>Doonesbury</i> has given readers a hip and happening place to be, if only for a few minutes every day.<p>Created by master cartoonist Garry Trudeau, <i>Doonesbury</i> remains a dynamic force. Its political slant consistently amuses readers, sparks controversy, and frightens editors. Political characters appear frequently--humorously represented by time bombs or waffles--but the strip isn't entirely political. Trudeau deals with young love, broken relationships, and the raising of a few young kids, but the strip isn't really about warm-fuzzies either. For the millions of readers who turn to <i>Doonesbury</i> every day, the strip is simply a favored friend. Controversial yet always contemporary; familiar but rarely perfectly comfortable.</p><p>In this collection, <i>Planet Doonesbury</i> continues the adventures of all the regulars, from Father Duke and his recently revealed son, Earl, to the impending marriage of Mike and Kim. B.D. returns to Vietnam, and with Phred as host, discovers a war of sorts is still being waged--not over changing politics, but the race to make money in the now industrialized country.</p><p>Presented in an exciting format, the handsome <i>Planet Doonesbury</i> features large-size color Sundays.</p></p><p>While Mike and Kim get serious, B.D. goes back to Vietnam and runs into an old friend--or was that enemy? Duke helps Donald Trump with some real estate problems, and in Washington it's time for Clinton versus Dole. Life as usual on <i>Planet Doonesbury</i>. Trudeau has never allowed himself to be left behind by events, and this volume, which tackles everything from Bob Dole's desperate desire for victory to Donald Trump's desperate desire for more money, shows that he remains in tip-top satirical condition as "Doonesbury" prepares to enter its fourth decade. Once again, political commentary is expertly blended with the ongoing story of Mike, Mark, Zonker, and friends as they struggle with encroaching middle age, sexual orientation, and the generation gap.<p>After Trudeau created the sequence about Donald Trump's aggressive attempts to grab property around his Atlantic City casino, "The Donald" said that "Trudeau is a jerk. A total loser. A pathetic moron. A third-rate talent." We'd guess that Mr. Trump is in a pretty small minority. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p></p><h2>Less Than One: Selected Essays</h2><p>This collection of essays amply demonstrates the wide range of the poet&#39;s interests and includes essays on poetry, politics, and literature and his memoir of life in Leningrad</p><p>This collection of essays thrusts Brodsky--heretofore known more for his poetry and translations--into the forefront of the &#34;Third Wave&#34; of Russian emigre writers. His insights into the works of Dostoyevsky, Mandelstam, Platonov, as well as non-Russian poets Auden, Cavafy and Montale are brilliant. While the Western popularity of many other Third Wavers has been stunted by their inability to write in English, Brodsky consumed the language to attain a &#34;closer proximity&#34; to poets such as Auden. The book, which won a National Book Critics Circle Award, opens and closes with revealing autobiographical essays.<p><b>Joseph Brodsky</b> (1940-96) came to the United States in 1972, an involuntary exile from the Soviet Union. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987 and served as Poet Laureate of the United States in 1991 and 1992.</p></p><h2>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>Amy Chua is the John M.

It's also about Mozart and Mendelssohn, the piano and the violin, and how we made it to Carnegie Hall.<br><br>This was <i>supposed</i> to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones.<br><br>But instead, it's about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how<br><br>I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old.<br><br><b>Part One</b><br><br>The Tiger, the living symbol of strength and power, generally inspires fear and respect.<br><br><b>The Chinese Mother</b><br><br>A lot of people wonder how Chinese parents raise such stereotypically successful kids. They wonder what these parents do to produce so many math whizzes and music prodigies, what it's like inside the family, and whether they could do it too. Well, I can tell them, because I've done it. Here are some things my daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were never allowed to do:<ul><li>attend a sleepover</li><br><li>have a playdate</li><br><li>be in a school play</li><br><li>complain about not being in a school play</li><br><li>watch TV or play computer games</li><br><li>choose their own extracurricular activities</li><br><li>get any grade less than an A</li><br><li>not be the #1 student in every subject except gym and drama</li><br><li>play any instrument other than the piano or violin</li><br><li>not play the piano or violin.</li><br></ul><br><br>I'm using the term "Chinese mother" loosely. I recently met a super-successful white guy from South Dakota (you've seen him on television), and after comparing notes we decided that his working-class father had definitely been a Chinese mother. I know some Korean, Indian, Jamaican, Irish, and Ghanaian parents who qualify too. Conversely, I know some mothers of Chinese heritage, almost always born in the West, who are <i>not</i> Chinese mothers, by choice or otherwise.<br><br>I'm also using the term "Western parents" loosely. Western parents come in all varieties. In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say that Westerners are far more diverse in their parenting styles than the Chinese. Some Western parents are strict; others are lax. There are same-sex parents, Orthodox Jewish parents, single parents, ex-hippie parents, investment banker parents, and military parents. None of these "Western" parents necessarily see eye to eye, so when I use the term "Western parents," of course I'm not referring to all Western parents&#x2014;just as "Chinese mother" doesn't refer to all Chinese mothers.<br><br>All the same, even when Western parents think they're being strict, they usually don't come close to being Chinese mothers. For example, my Western friends who consider themselves strict make their children practice their instruments thirty minutes every day. An hour at most. For a Chinese mother, the first hour is the easy part. It's hours two and three that get tough.<br><br>Despite our squeamishness about cultural stereotypes, there are tons of studies out there showing marked and quantifiable differences between Chinese and Westerners when it comes to parenting. In one study of 50 Western American mothers and 48 Chinese immigrant mothers, almost 70% of the Western mothers said either that "stressing academic success is not good for children" or that "parents need to foster the idea that learning is fun." By contrast, roughly 0% of the Chinese mothers felt the same way. Instead, the vast majority of the Chinese mothers said that they believe their children can be "the best" students, that "academic achievement reflects successful parenting," and that if children did not excel at school then there was "a problem" and parents "were not doing their job." Other studies indicate that compared to Western parents, Chinese parents spend approximately ten times as long every day drilling academic activities with their children. By contrast, Western kids are more likely to participate in sports teams.<br><br>This brings me to my final point. Some might think that the American sports parent is an analog to the Chinese mother. This is so wrong. Unlike your typical Western over-scheduling soccer mom, the Chinese mother believes that (1) schoolwork always comes first; (2) an A-minus is a bad grade; (3) your children must be two years ahead of their classmates in math; (4) you must never compliment your children in public; (5) if your child ever disagrees with a teacher or coach, you must always take the side of the teacher or coach; (6) the only activities your children should be permitted to do are those in which they can eventually win a medal; and (7) that medal must be gold.</p><h2>Grit Lit: A Rough South Reader (Non Series)</h2><p>Drawing on storytelling traditions as old as southern literature itself, Grit Lit is the first anthology devoted to contemporary writing about the Rough South.

This book provides the most complete and accurate assessment of the probability of conflict between the United States and the rising Asian superpower. Equally important, it lays out an in-depth analysis of the possible pathways to peace. Written like a geopolitical detective story, the narrative encourages listener interaction by starting each chapter with an intriguing question that often challenges conventional wisdom. Based on interviews with more than 30 top experts, the author highlights a number of disturbing facts about China's recent military buildup and the shifting balance of power in Asia: the Chinese are deploying game-changing "carrier killer" ballistic missiles; some of America's supposed allies in Europe and Asia are selling highly lethal weapons systems to China in a perverse twist on globalization; and, on the US side, debilitating cutbacks in the military budget send a message to the world that America is not serious about its "pivot to Asia". In the face of these threatening developments, the book stresses the importance of maintaining US military strength and preparedness and strengthening alliances, while warning against a complacent optimism that relies on economic engagement, negotiations, and nuclear deterrence to ensure peace. </p><p>Accessible to listeners from all walks of life, this multidisciplinary work blends geopolitics, economics, history, international relations, military doctrine, and political science to provide a better understanding of one of the most vexing problems facing the world. </p></p><p><b>Peter Navarro</b> is a professor at the Merage School of Business at the University of California-Irvine.

The text intimates the ancient belief that once an individual knows the name of something, he possesses its spirit. (This belief is explained in the flap copy but not in the text.) The narrator wishes to go to the "School of Names" and recognize all of the elements in the world and thus be at home spiritually on our planet. The uncluttered pastel drawings of fish, trees, stars, etc., are done in muted colors on lightly textured paper and are set off with a frame of white space on all sides. The theme of understanding and appreciating our environment is related to Goffstein's other works, such as Goldie the Dollmaker (1969) and Two Piano Tuners (1971, both Farrar) in that their concern is with human fulfillment. The poignant search for "The School of Names" described by the narrator combines with the delicate drawings to make a special book for Goffstein devotees. Lorraine Douglas, Winnipeg Public Library, Manitoba, Canada<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.In Goffstein's latest, we recognize the theme central to her unique creations. Speaking always of what she loves, she turns our thoughts to what is dear to us. Here the colors in small, delicate paintings are muted but seem lit with an inner glow. The illustrations and text again reveal Goffstein's gift for confining a world of meaning in the fewest figures and words. With utmost simplicity, she expresses her yearning to know by name the intricate wonders on this planet. What is each called: star, sky, desert, rock, cloud, person, tree, animal, every single part of the symbiotic mystery? As the author writes, "For all the years I may live, no place but the earth is my home." She gives us in her beautiful book a reminder that we must exist harmoniously with nature in the place that is the only home for all of us. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The crack in the teacup</h2><p>MINOR WEAR ON EDGES OF SPINE AND COVERS.

NO WRITING OR MARKS ON PAGES.</p><p>Born in Lincolnshire, England, Michael Francis Gilbert graduated in law from the University of London in 1937, shortly after which he first spent some time teaching at a prep-school which was followed by six years serving with the Royal Horse Artillery. During World War II he was captured following service in North Africa and Italy, and his prisoner-of-war experiences later leading to the writing of the acclaimed novel &#39;Death in Captivity&#39; in 1952. After the war, Gilbert worked as a solicitor in London, but his writing continued throughout his legal career and in addition to novels he wrote stage plays and scripts for radio and television. He is, however, best remembered for his novels, which have been described as witty and meticulously-plotted espionage and police procedural thrillers, but which exemplify realism. HRF Keating stated that &#39;Smallbone Deceased&#39; was amongst the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. &#34;The plot,&#34; wrote Keating, &#34;is in every way as good as those of Agatha Christie at her best: as neatly dovetailed, as inherently complex yet retaining a decent credibility, and as full of cunningly-suggested red herrings.&#34; It featured Chief Inspector Hazlerigg, who went on to appear in later novels and short stories, and another series was built around Patrick Petrella, a London based police constable (later promoted) who was fluent in four languages and had a love for both poetry and fine wine. Other memorable characters around which Gilbert built stories included Calder and Behrens. They are elderly but quite amiable agents, who are nonetheless ruthless and prepared to take on tasks too much at the dirty end of the business for their younger colleagues. They are brought out of retirement periodically upon receiving a bank statement containing a code. Much of Michael Gilbert&#39;s writing was done on the train as he travelled from home to his office in London: &#34;I always take a latish train to work,&#34; he explained in 1980, &#34;and, of course, I go first class. I have no trouble in writing because I prepare a thorough synopsis beforehand.&#34;. After retirement from the law, however, he nevertheless continued and also reviewed for &#39;The Daily Telegraph&#39;, as well as editing &#39;The Oxford Book of Legal Anecdotes&#39;. Gilbert was appointed CBE in 1980. Generally regarded as &#39;one of the elder statesmen of the British crime writing fraternity&#39;, he was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers&#39; Association and in 1988 he was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, before receiving the Lifetime &#39;Anthony&#39; Achievement award at the 1990 Boucheron in London. Michael Gilbert died in 2006, aged ninety three, and was survived by his wife and their two sons and five daughters."So full of zest it makes and effortless read" (<i>The Observer</i>)<br><br>"Emits realism and variety - the canvas stretches far enough to include legal eagles and cold-eyed city men - this is Mr. Gilbert's best book for years" (<i>Sunday Times</i>)<br><br>"Author in crackling, spell-binding form, and cynical throway twist at the end is masterly." (<i>Sunday Telegraph</i>)<br><br>"Mr. Gilbert writes like a bat out of hell and plays his clues close to his chest." (<i>The New Yorker</i>)</p><h2>Ojibwa Crafts</h2><p>In the first half of the twentieth century, the Ojibwa (Chippewa) people of the western Great Lakes region still retained many of their traditional tribal ways of life, ways of life which included a wealth of ingenious and clever crafts based upon their understanding and use of natural local materials. With few tools but a long history, skilled artisans created the everyday articles needed for shelter, food preparation, clothing, and ceremonials; they also found time to make decorative items for exchange at trading posts or for sale to tourists who passed through their lands.</p><p>Carrie A.

Writing of earlier volumes, the New Yorker said that `Herbert is one of the finest and most original writers of this century...a stubbornly idiosyncratic poet of isolation, disinheritance, and grief.&#39; Mr Cogito acts as the award-winning poet&#39;s alibi, alias, persona, or as Seamus Heaney has said, `as a representative of the most courageous, well-disposed and unremittingly intelligent members of the species. This book is intended for admirers of Zbigniew Herbert; readers of poetry; libraries; universities.</p><p><p>Zbigniew Herbert was born in Lw�w, Poland, in 1924. In his late teens he fought in the under-ground resistance against the Nazis. Herbert studied law, economics, and philosophy at the universities of Krakow, Torun, and Warsaw.

But when the &#39;red&#39; strangers come, sunburned Europeans who seek to colonize their homeland, the lives of the two Kikuyu tribesmen begin to change in dramatic new ways. Soon, their people are overwhelmed by unknown diseases that traditional magic seems powerless to control. And as the strangers move across the land, the tribe rapidly finds itself forced to obey foreign laws that seem at best bizarre, and that at worst entirely contradict the Kikuyu&#39;s own ancient ways, rituals and beliefs.</p><p>Elspeth Huxley (1907-1997) was the daughter of Major Josceline Grant of Njoro, Kenya where she spent most of her childhood. She was educated at the European School in Nairobi and at Reading University where she took a diploma in agriculture, and atCornell University. In 1929 she joined the Empire Marketing Board as a press officer and, following her marriage to Gervase Huxley in 1931, travelled widely with him in America, Africa and elsewhere.</p><h2>The Wreck of the River of Stars</h2><p>Michael Flynn has written the best SF in the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein of the last decade. His major work was the Firestar sequence, a four-book future history. "As Robert A. Heinlein did and all too few have done since, Michael Flynn writes about the near future as if he'd been there and was bringing back reports of what he'd seen," said Harry Turtledove. Now, in this sweeping stand-alone epic of the spaceways, Flynn grows again in stature, with an SF novel worthy of the master himself. Indeed, if Heinlein's famous character, the space-faring poet Rhysling, had ever written a novel, this would be it.<br><br>This is a compelling tale of the glory that was. In the days of the great sailing ships, in the mid-twenty-first century, when magnetic sails drew cargo and passengers alike to every corner of the solar system, sailors had the highest status of all spacemen, and the crew of the luxury liner the <i>River of Stars</i>, the highest among all sailors. <br><br>But development of the Farnsworth fusion drive doomed the sailing ships, and now the <i>River of Stars</i> is the last of its kind, retrofitted with engines, her mast vestigial, her sails unraised for years. An ungainly hybrid, she operates in the late years of the century as a mere tramp freighter among the outer planets, and her crew is a motley group of misfits. Stepan Gorgas is the escapist executive officer who becomes captain. Ramakrishnan Bhatterji is the chief engineer who disdains him. Eugenie Satterwaithe, once a captain herself, is third officer and, for form's sake, sailing master.<br><br>When an unlikely and catastrophic engine failure strikes the <i>River</i>, Bhatterji is confident he can effect repairs with heroic engineering, but Satterwaithe and the other sailors among the crew plot to save her with a glorious last gasp for the old ways, mesmerized by a vision of arriving at Jupiter proudly under sail. The story of their doom has the power, the poetry, and the inevitability of a Greek tragedy. This is a great science fiction novel, Flynn's best yet.<br></p><p>In his excellent novel <i>The Wreck of The River of Stars</i>, Michael Flynn looks back on the romantic Age of Sail: the second, high-tech Age of Sail, when spaceships with vast magnetic sails rode the solar winds across the immense ocean of space, and the greatest of the luxury spaceliners was <i>The River of Stars</i>. But the second Age of Sail is dead: the magnetic sails all were struck, and the spaceships all were retrofitted with the new Farnsworth fusion drive. Once a legend, <i>The River of Stars</i> is now a tramp cargo freighter, plying the outer planets with a scanty crew of men and women with questionable pasts, private agendas, and more than a little interpersonal friction.<p> When a bizarre failure disables the Farnsworth engines driving <i>The River of Stars</i>, the crew has a problem no Earthly sailor ever faced: their ports don't stay put. If <i>The River of Stars</i> doesn't arrive on schedule, Jupiter will be somewhere else in its enormous orbit. That means the damaged ship will speed out of the solar system and drift forever among the stars. The crew's only hope appears to be the magnetic sail. But recreating a long-gone high-tech sail isn't the worst problem this motley crew faces. To survive, they must achieve something even more herculean: they must overcome their own intricately entangled fears, hatreds, power struggles, and romantic disasters. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Michael Flynn is an Analog magazine alumnus whose fiction now appears regularly in all the major SF magazines.

Judy Blume was the first author to write candidly about a sexually active teen, and she&#39;s been defending teenagers&#39; rights to read about such subjects ever since. Here, Blume tells a convincing tale of first love--a love that seems strong and true enough to last forever. Katherine loves Michael so much, in fact, that she&#39;s willing to lose her virginity to him, and, as the months go by, it gets harder and harder for her to imagine living without him. However, something happens when they are separated for the summer: Katherine begins to have feelings for another guy. What does this mean about her love for Michael? What does this mean about love in general? What does &#34;forever&#34; mean, anyway? As always, Blume writes as if she&#39;s never forgotten a moment of what it&#39;s like to be a teenager.Judy Blume, one of America&#x2019;s most popular authors, is the recipient of the 2004 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.

Such a crushing Roman defeat by Gothic cavalry proved to the Empire, as well as to the Goths themselves, that the migratory barbarians were a force to be reckoned with. This book tells the story of the misguided Roman plans and the surprise attack of Gothic cavalry, and puts forward the most recent theories as to the true location of the battlefield.</p><p>Highly visual guides to history&#39;s greatest conflicts, detailing the command strategies, tactics, and experiences of the opposing forces throughout each campaign, and concluding with a guide to the battlefields today.SIMON MACDOWALL is a former army officer with a deep interest in military history, especially the period around the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West.

A transcendent piece of writing, it won the Pulitzer Prize and the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award.For four years Leon Dash of the <i>Washington Post</i> followed the lives of Rosa Lee Cunningham, her children, and five of her grandchildren, in an effort to understand the persistence of poverty and pathology within America's black underclass. Rosa Lee's life story spans a half century of hardship in the slums and housing projects of Southeast Washington, a stone's throw from the marble halls and civic monuments of the world's most prosperous nation. Yet for all of America's efforts, Rosa Lee and millions like her remain trapped in a cycle of poverty characterized by illiteracy, teenage pregnancy, drugs, and violent crime.Dash brings us into her life and the lives of her family members offering a human drama that statistics can only refer to. He also shows how some people&#x2014;including two of Rosa Lee's children&#x2014;have made it out of the ghetto, breaking the cycle to lead stable middle-class lives in the mainstream of American society.</p><p>Drug-addled, welfare-using and AIDS-infected, Rosa Lee--a black woman living in the slums of Washington, D.C.--shines an enormous amount of light on the seemingly intractable problems of the underclass by allowing Leon Dash to tell her story. You won't find any diagrams or number-crunching in this book, just an absorbing tale of inner-city despair. Dash won the Pulitzer Prize for his series of articles on Rosa Lee for the <i>Washington Post</i>.

Films such as Breathless, Contempt, A Woman Is a Woman, Les Carabiniers, Alphaville, and others during the 1950s and 1960s made him virtually synonymous with French New Wave Cinema, a movement that revolutionized filmmaking everywhere, the ripples of which are still being felt today in the films of such directors as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, and Quentin Tarantino. Godard was not only a filmmaker, but also a critic and theorist who wrote extensively for the influential New Wave journal Cahiers du Cinema, and he holds definite views on his chosen art form, views that have cemented his legend, and views that he discusses at length in this book that presents, for the first time in English, an important interview with him.

But this week, it&#39;s gone a bit out of control. A local group of activists calling themselves the Farberville Green Party is protesting a developer&#39;s plan to remove a copse of trees by having retired schoolteacher Miss Emily Parchester camp out in one of them while chained to it by the ankle. While concerned about the aged Miss Parchester&#39;s vigil in the tree, Claire isn&#39;t able to talk her down-and if that wasn&#39;t turmoil enough, a baby is left on Claire&#39;s doorstep with a note from his mother asking her to care for him for a few days. While trying to track down the mother, Claire tries to avoid alerting either the authorities or the local gossips, but both efforts are doomed to failure. When Claire is sighted buying diapers, the unlikely rumor that her daughter has an illegitimate child runs rampant in Caron&#39;s high school. And when Claire does track down the mother of the child, it is because the teenager has been arrested for the murder of her own father - who is the local developer at the center of the controversy surrounding the trees. Unconvinced that the baby&#39;s mother is really responsible, and juggling feedings and diaperings for the first time in fifteen-some years, Claire decides that the only way to rescue Caron&#39;s reputation and the baby&#39;s mother - not to mention coaxing Miss Parchester down out of the tree - is to uncover the truth behind the murder.</p><p><p>Praise for the <i>Claire Malloy Mystery Series</i></p><p>"Joan Hess is one of the funniest people in the mystery world."-Margaret Maron, author of <i>Slow Dollar </i></p><p>"With her wry asides, Claire makes a most engaging narrator...the surprising denouement comes off with eclat."-<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Joan Hess is seriously funny.

On the contrary, their business acumen amounted to little more than making things up as they went along. <i>Beatles For Sale</i> offers the facts and figures behind this story, and explains how it helped shape the music business as we know it.

He has been a story analyst for many major film and television companies, including American Playhouse, ABC, and Hallmark Entertainment. He grew up in Baltimore and now lives in New York City.In his fifth amusing gig after 2003's <i>Murder in the Hearse Degree</i>, Hitchcock Sewell, sage undertaker by profession and amateur sleuth by inclination, is drawn into a nasty murder case by an old high school chum. A bit rough around the edges, Jonathan "Sisco" Fontaine lives somewhat dangerously, especially after hooking up with a married woman, Polly Weisheit. When Polly's husband turns up dead with a knife in his back, neither Polly nor Sisco phones the police. Sisco's bright idea is an urgent call to Hitch, who rushes over. Hitch politely refuses his friend's request to make the body disappear, but ends up in hot water anyway after neighbors report seeing a hearse at the Weisheit home before police are called to the scene. Cranky Lieutenant Kruk, Hitch's longtime nemesis, is none too pleased to find Hitch involved in another bizarre murder. Toss in decades-old secrets, greed, jealousy, troubled teens, a lovesick thug and nefarious deeds at a local nursing home, and Hitch is neck deep in mayhem. Aunt Billie and ex-wife Julia are along for the ride, as well as Angela, a new love interest for Hitch.

Firefighters named the fire &#x201c;the Beast.&#x201d; It acted like a mythical animal, alive with destructive energy, and they hoped never to see anything like it again. Yet it&#x2019;s not a stretch to imagine we will all soon live in a world in which fires like the Beast are commonplace. A glance at international headlines shows a remarkable increase in higher temperatures, stronger winds, and drier lands&#x2013; a trifecta for igniting wildfires like we&#x2019;ve rarely seen before.<br><br> This change is particularly noticeable in the northern forests of the United States and Canada. These forests require fire to maintain healthy ecosystems, but as the human population grows, and as changes in climate, animal and insect species, and disease cause further destabilization, wildfires have turned into a potentially uncontrollable threat to human lives and livelihoods.<br><br> Our understanding of the role fire plays in healthy forests has come a long way in the past century. Despite this, we are not prepared to deal with an escalation of fire during periods of intense drought and shorter winters, earlier springs, potentially more lightning strikes and hotter summers. There is too much fuel on the ground, too many people and assets to protect, and no plan in place to deal with these challenges.<br><br> In <i>Firestorm</i>, journalist Edward Struzik visits scorched earth from Alaska to Maine, and introduces the scientists, firefighters, and resource managers making the case for a radically different approach to managing wildfire in the 21st century. Wildfires can no longer be treated as avoidable events because the risk and dangers are becoming too great and costly. Struzik weaves a heart-pumping narrative of science, economics, politics, and human determination and points to the ways that we, and the wilder inhabitants of the forests around our cities and towns, might yet flourish in an age of growing megafires.</p><p>A gripping narrative about the new reality of wildfire in North America.Edward Struzik is an award-winning writer and photographer.

Due to growing interest in his research, Mr. Martell created a network, of what is now, one of the world's most visited websites attracting over 1 million new visitors each year. The website ranks in the "Top 10" most visited paranormal websites on the Internet according to Google. Today, Mr. Martell is working in his next scientific recreation of ancient technology based upon data obtained from Sumerian cuneiform cylinder seals from 3000 BCE. He is also in the planning stages of several groundbreaking international research expeditions. The expeditions focus on gaining access to ancient Sumerian artifacts, and other archeological relics not currently accessible to the public. By bringing worldwide attention to these hidden artifacts, Mr. Martell hopes to usher in a new era in the Ancient Astronaut theory.</p><h2>Ashes and Ice</h2><p>When heartache and loss invade Karen Pierce&#39;s carefully ordered world, she is devastated.

California's Coast-to-Coast Road Trip Challenge--and it's putting $5,000 scholarships in the winners' pockets! Elizabeth is beyond psyched when she's picked to compete.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her teammates totally rock--except for slacker supreme Sam Burgess.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's cocky, egotistical, and party-crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of guy Elizabeth hates...falling in love with.<br><br>Jessica Wakefield can't believe she's stuck on the same road-trip as Tom Watts and Todd Wilkins!&nbsp;&nbsp;How repulsive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her only salvation is gorgeous Neil Martin.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's witty, sophisticated, intelligent, and best of all, single.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessica's dying to have her wicked way with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;What could possibly stop her?</p><p>"Is this the life or what?" Jessica Wakefield shouted. She threw back her head and let her long, blond hair whip around her face. "There's no better way to travel in California than in a convertible with the top down."<br><br>Her identical twin, Elizabeth, laughed, tapping her fingers against the steering wheel as she drove. "For once, Jess, you and I are in complete agreement."<br><br>The twins were on their way to San Francisco to participate in the Intense Cable Sports Network's big summer Coast-to-Coast Road Trip Challenge. From the very moment Elizabeth had told her about the contest, Jessica knew she had to be part of it. And now her dream was finally coming true. She would be traveling across the country, stopping at exciting and interesting pieces, performing crazy stunts for points. It would be a chance to meet new people and see new things. And best of all, if her team won, she'd receive a five-thousand-dollar scholarship.<br><br>Jessica flipped down the visor and checked her lipstick in the tiny mirror. Perfect as always. "No chaperon, no worries--no rules!" She leaned down and flicked on the radio, then reached over and yanked the scrunchie out of Elizabeth's ponytail, letting her blond hair loose.<br><br>"Hey, I'm trying to drive here!" Elizabeth shook her hair out of her face. "It might help if I could see where I'm going."<br><br>"Loosen up, Liz!" Jessica shouted gleefully. "It's time for new beginnings. Change is in the wind. Flow with it."<br><br>"The only thing flowing at the moment is my hair," Elizabeth said.<br><br>Jessica faked a pout and loosened her seat belt enough to lean over and twist Elizabeth's hair back into a ponytail--or a reasonable facsimile. She backed away to view her efforts and wrinkled her nose. "Well, it's not one hundred percent straight, but you can fix it when we stop."<br><br>"Thanks a lot," Elizabeth muttered. She lowered the volume on the radio. "Speaking of change in the wind, did you realize you only brought along one duffel bag and one small suitcase?"<br><br>Jessica shrugged. "That's all the instruction letter said we could bring."<br><br>"I know that. But a little thing like a rule has never stopped you before. Jess, we're going to be gone four whole weeks. You usually take more luggage than that on an overnighter."<br><br>"You got me there." Jessica laughed. She was actually glad to be free from one of her old, typical Jessica-isms. She'd been working hard lately to figure out who she was and where she wanted to go with her life. Packing lighter wasn't a huge change, but it was a start. "Do you think I'm losing it?"<br><br>"I never thought I'd say this," Elizabeth joked. "But I think maybe you're maturing."<br><br>Jessica smiled and gazed out at the road ahead. "Not according to Lila," she said. "She thinks I've gone crazy. You should have seen her this weekend at her Fourth of July party. If her nose had gotten any higher in the air, she'd have keeled over." Jessica raised her voice about half an octave and perfectly mimicked her best friend's pretentious tone. "'How can you even <i>think</i> of participating in that tacky little contest, I can't think of anything worse than traveling all over the country cooped up in a camper with five complete strangers.'"<br><br>Elizabeth rolled her eyes. "She's just jealous."<br><br>"You know it and I know it, but I don't think she does," Jessica said. "She had this whole story worked out about how she'd planned to go to Europe all along."<br><br>"Then how did she explain the fact that she filled out an entry form?" Elizabeth asked.<br><br>"I think she conveniently forgot that little detail," Jessica said sarcastically. "What about Nina? Was she upset that she wasn't chosen?"<br><br>Elizabeth shook her head, never taking her eyes from the road. "She didn't even apply and couldn't believe I did. According to her, performing demeaning and disgraceful stunts just so a TV show doesn't have to hire actors is not something that a serious person like Elizabeth Wakefield would even consider."<br><br>"Well, you have to admit, it is a little out of character," Jessica pointed out. "Seeking adventure has never been one of your strong suits."<br><br>"True. But after spending a trillion hours in the library studying for finals, I figured a change of scenery would be a good idea," Elizabeth said.<br><br>"Tell me about it," Jessica said with a laugh. "I was beginning to think you were going to become one with your reading-room cubicle."<br><br>Elizabeth shook her head, smiling ruefully. "I thought I'd never make it through that last week of school. I was totally stressed. But now that our freshman year is over and the pressure is gone, I feel really optimistic. I think this whole experience is going to be good for me. I feel different somehow. What do you think?"<br><br>"I know <i>something</i>'s different. You should have seen Dad's face when you returned from the car rental with this red Mustang." Jessica ran her hands appreciatively over the dashboard. "I think he must have thought you were me."<br><br>"I know." Elizabeth grinned at her sister. "I had already filled out the paperwork for a little economy car, but then I saw this parked out front and . . . I don't know. I just couldn't help myself."<br><br>"That's the attitude!" Jessica cheered, throwing her arms into the air. "Out with the old and in with the new!"<br>"It was really sweet of you to offer to come to the airport with me this morning and take care of my car while I'm gone," Todd Wilkins said as he steered his BMW into the right lane for departing flights.<br><br>Beside him his girlfriend, Dana Upshaw, said nothing. She'd been quiet all morning, and it was beginning to freak Todd out a bit. Usually Dana was as bubbly as a shaken glass of Sprite.<br><br>"Dana, did you hear me?" Despite having to concentrate on the heavy traffic, he glanced across the seat at her. Dana was staring straight ahead, her expression stony. Todd felt his shoulders start to tense up.<br><br>"OK, what's the deal?" he asked. "Why are you giving me the silent treatment?"<br><br>Her shrug was hardly perceivable.<br><br>Todd gasped and slammed on the brakes as a black Bronco cut in front of him. He barely missed plowing into the guy. "Dana, I can't do the sign-language thing right now. Will you please speak to me? What's bugging you?"<br><br>"Aren't you even going to park?" Somehow she made her words sound more like an accusation than a question.<br><br>"No, it's too expensive." He passed a slow-moving minivan. "And besides, it takes too long. This way I can just jump out and grab my stuff, and you can take off." He reached over and laid his hand affectionately just below the hem of her green miniskirt. "There's really no point in you coming inside just to wait around the airport with me."<br><br>She brushed his hand off her leg as if it were a bug and tugged the hem of her skirt lower. "Did it ever occur to you that I might want to wait around with you? After all, it'll be the last chance I'll have to see you for four whole weeks."<br><br>Four weeks didn't seem that long to Todd, but he knew that nothing he said was going to convince Dana. They'd been arguing about his going on this ICSN trip ever since he'd gotten the notification that he'd been chosen. With a sigh and a quick rearview glance, Todd stomped the accelerator and squeezed into the lane that led to short-term parking.<br><br>The driver in the Corvette behind him honked and flipped him off, but Todd ignored him. He had his own worries at the moment.<br><br>Dana uncrossed her arms and legs and settled back in the seat, temporarily mollified. It didn't last long, however. The minute Todd parked the car, her tears began to fall.<br><br>"Dana," Todd whispered. "Please don't do this now."<br><br>"I can't help it," she said with a sniff.<br><br>He pushed her lovely mahogany curls away from her face and kissed her wet cheeks. She slid into his arms, and he held her until her crying died down.<br><br>"Are you OK now?" Todd asked.<br><br>She nodded and pulled a Kleenex out of the crazy, kiddie lunch box she was using for a purse.<br><br>With Dana sniffling along beside him, Todd grabbed his duffel bag from the trunk, slung it over one shoulder, and headed for the terminal. They were hardly inside when Dana grabbed him around the waist and clung to him as if she were being abandoned. Todd strained to see the overhead departing-flight screens. "My flight is right on time. They'll start boarding any minute now." He peeled Dana's arms away and tried to put a little space between them. Dana was a beautiful woman, and over the past few months she'd come to mean a lot to him. But lately she had become way too possessive and clingy.<br><br>"I still don't see why you have to do this," she whined.<br><br>"Dana, please," Todd said, trying to keep the edge out of his voice. "We've been through this."<br><br>She plopped onto a padded bench and pulled him down beside her. Sliding a hand under his shirt, she began caressing his back and nibbling at his ear.<br><br>"OK, you've definitely got my attention," he said, capturing her hand somewhat reluctantly.<br><br>"I don't want you to go on this trip." Dana was practically whimpering.<br><br>Todd dropped his head and let out a frustrated breath. "Dana, only eight people from SW were selected. I can't just bail."<br><br>"They picked alternates. Let one of them go in your place," Dana said, her voice hopeful. "Tom Watts was an alternate, wasn't he? We could call him right now. I'll bet he'd drop everything for a chance to ch...</p><h2>The First Heroes: The Extraordinary Story of the Doolittle Raid- America&#39;s First World War II Victory</h2><p>A nail-biting account of the Doolittle Raid against Tokyo explores this seminal event in the early stages of World War II, and discusses its ramifications in terms of the Allied war effort, and profiles the men who took part in the raid. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Advance praise for Craig Nelson's THE FIRST HEROES: <br><br> "The Doolittle Raid was Franklin Roosevelt's answer to Pearl Harbor. The gutsy mission shocked the Japanese, electrified America, and determined the shape and tenor of the entire Pacific War. If you want to read one book to understand how a humbled America rose to defeat mighty Japan, you hold that book in your hands. Read about the original 'Mission Impossible' of World War II. Read about the boys who flew off into history, believing they would never come back. Read about the boys who were the first heroes." (James Bradley, author of <i>Flags of Our Fathers</i>) <br><br> "<i>The First Heroes</i> is epic in sweep. The story of the Doolittle Raid lifts off the page, as rich and engrossing as any legend, and Craig Nelson proceeds to bring to vivid life the dramatic story behind the story. This is an astonishing feat - the hours breathe with even the tiniest gesture of young men desperately fighting to stay alive, against the panorama of modern war and a turbulent century in the making. Nelson is an amazing storyteller." (Doug Stanton, author of <i>In Harm's Way</i>) <br><br> "In this passionate and intimate history, Craig Nelson reminds us that America's first response to Pearl Harbor was neither tepid nor undramatic, but rather one of warfare's boldest chapters of righteous revenge." (Hampton Sides, author of <i>Ghost Soldiers</i>) <br><br> "I vividly remember as a boy, in the demoralizing months following Pearl Harbor, the disbelief and elation that greeted news that American bombers had actually struck Tokyo! Now Craig Nelson has given us every detail, every secret, every story behind this raid, which first taught an insecure nation that we could hit this enemy and, in time, defeat him." (Joseph E. Persico, author of <i>Roosevelt's Secret War</i>) <br><br> "Craig Nelson has produced a book that is, quite simply, unforgettable. The First Heroes lives and moves with staggering power and vitality. I never wanted it to end." (Leon Bing, author of <i>Do or Die</i>) <br><br> "<i>The First Heroes</i> is the best kind of history: important, thoughtful, and wonderfully gripping. Craig Nelson has done a splendid job of making America's first victory in World War II seem so vital, so relevant, that reading it feels like living it." (Susan Isaacs, author of <i>Long Time No See</i> and <i>Compromising Positions</i>)Craig Nelson is the author of three previous books, most recently <i>Let's Get Lost</i>.

The theme of these erudite essays by a Harvard professor is that great historians' personal crises and childhood influences molded the way they wrote and the strategies they employed to give their writing its staying power. Edward Gibbon, presented here as a great wit--which is how his contemporaries viewed him--used sexual innuendo and sneers at religion to win over readers of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire to his point of view. Thomas Macaulay, a habitual daydreamer, draped his narratives over a scaffold of seemingly haphazard anecdotes. Clive ( Macaulay: The Shaping of the Historian ) also probes "enlightened conservative" Alexis de Tocqueville and Jacob Burckhardt, Swiss critic of the modern nation-state, among others. History Book Club alternate. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.These essays explore the influence of personal preoccupation in shaping the historian's choice of subject and the role played by craft in writing history. Through examination of the historical writings of Gibbon, Macaulay, Carlyle, Burckhardt, Tocqueville, Marx, and Adams, Clive explores "the relationship between style and content . . . " in historical writing. He argues for "literary as well as substantive molds." One seldom finds the results of serious scholarship printed as gracefully as they are in this worthwhile collection of essays on the art and craft of history writing. It is no surprise that Clive, author of a National Book Award-winning study of Macaulay ( Macaulay: The Shape of the Historian), is sympathetic to that master historian, but he is fair to all of his subjects (including the much-analyzed Carlyle).

His pace is moderate as he patiently explains the processes of goal setting, calculating interest payments, and conducting debt analysis, among others. The overall effect of his narration is persuasive as the authors&#39; dismantle any objections to their four laws. Their sentences are lengthy and complex, so Peterson&#39;s controlled reading will aid the listener, who might otherwise have difficulty. He handles the numerous rhetorical questions peppered throughout the text in a realistic and engaging manner.

Voluntary emigration from the British Isles went into a steep decline after the year 1750, only to rise again sharply from 1770 and to reach epidemic proportions by 1773, a year of great economic hardship in Britain. Involuntary emigration, on the other hand, the forced transportation of criminals of almost every degree, rose sharply during the period, from a yearly total of 500 in 1750 to 1,000 in 1774-75. The records drawn on, in addition to the usual sources, include port books, plantation apprenticeship bindings, and treasury records of emigrants departing from English ports. Now that it is completed, Mr. Coldham&#39;s remarkable achievement identifies about 100,000 English emigrants to colonial Amkerica from virtually every reference that can be found in England.</p><p></p><h2>Fairy Tail, Vol. 12</h2><p>THE DOOMSDAY WEAPON!<br> &nbsp;<br> Erza and Natsu are trying to stop Jellal from reviving the most feared black wizard the world has ever known!

He has written on the American Revolution, World War I, and World War II, and is the author of DK&#x2019;s <i>Battle</i>, <i>Warrior</i>, and <i>Flight: 100 Years of Aviation.</i>Written by a team of British military historians, this oversize volume seizes attention with the publisher's brand-name design: images surrounded by information-packed captions silhouetted against a white or a black background. Its pictures are sure to snare the substantial audience interested in the history of swords, guns, and body armor. Limiting the subject to portable armaments, the work extends from the first likely weapon (a rock) to the rifles issued to contemporary infantrymen. In most cases, the emphasis is on the tools of the ordinary soldier, his equipage through time explained with arrowed illustrations. The evolution of handheld weaponry is soon apparent, with that of firearms especially prominent. Some guns depicted here will be recognizable (think AK-47) even to those who recoil from guns.

Archaeological evidence is used to demonstrate the existence or otherwise of international trade and to examine the physical characteristics of textiles and their distribution in order to understand who was producing, using and trading them and what they were being used for. Historical evidence, mainly textual, is employed to link textile names to places, numbers and prices and thus provide an appreciation of changing economics, patterns of distribution and the organisation of trade. Different types and qualities of cloths are discussed and the social implications of their production and import/export considered against a developing background of urbanism and increasing commercial wealth.</p><p></p><h2>Provenance</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

While Union spies failed to penetrate Jefferson Davis&#x2019;s inner circle, the Confederacy had a deeply entrenched network of undercover agents throughout the Federal Government, especially in the War Department.<br>This intriguing account, written by a former intelligence officer of the U. S. Army, offers a well-documented history of the spies who served the Southern cause. Manuscripts from state and national archives, historical journals, and government records, as well as personal narratives published by many of the agents themselves, describe the risky business of the Confederate spies. The cast of historical figures is dotted with colorful personalities: Mrs. Rose Greenhow, the devious Rebel Rose, and her strategic romantic conquests; John Singleton Mosby, the hard-riding Gray Ghost; and a host of other spies, famous and obscure. Thrill-packed commentaries detail the activities of Rebel agents in Washington, at Bull Run, Gettysburg, and elsewhere, telling of false orders, wiretaps, fraud, and other treacherous maneuvers.<br>Civil War buffs, students of American history, and spy story devotees will find this fascinating account of true-life adventures particularly absorbing and enlightening.</p><p>"These tales of daring intrigue...are exciting reading depicting courage, selflessness, and devotion to a cause," said LJ's reviewer of this chronicle of the South's use of spooks during the Civil War. Though not all will agree with the author's conclusions, these "hair-raising experiences" make for fun reading nonetheless. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Redeemers: Ideas and Power in Latin America</h2><p><em>An epicintellectual history of Latin America by one of the region&#x2019;s most prominentthinkers</em><br><p>Inhis first book to appear in English since <em>Mexico: Biography in Power</em>, awork which the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>calls &#x201c;the standard history ofpostcolonial Mexico,&#x201d; prize-winning author Enrique Krauzeilluminates the evolution of political, social, and philosophical discourses inLatin America. With echoes of Richard Hofstadter and Edmund Wilson, Krauze explores the Latin American intellectual traditionby deftly animating its decisive figures, from Octavio Paz to Che Guevara, Jos� Vasconcelos toHugo Ch�vez, and inscribing them upon a vivid landscape of patriotism,opportunism, morality, and avarice&#x2014;and of love, honor, loyalty, and identity. <em>Redeemers</em>delivers an unparalleled explication of the roots of ideology and action inLatin America today.</p></p><p><p>Latin America has been of vital importance to the United States almost since the birth of our nation, and the significance of this relationship has only increased in recent decades. But mutual understanding between these regions is lacking, even as Latin Americans are striving to promote the values of democracy in their native countries and beyond. Why has this process proved to be such a struggle, and what does the future of the region hold? </p><p>In <em>Redeemers</em>, acclaimed historian Enrique Krauze presents the major ideas that have formed the modern Latin American political mind during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from early postcolonial authoritarian regimes to nineteenth-century Liberalism and Conservatism, and then the impact of Socialism and Marxism as well as nationalism and indigenism and the movement toward liberal democracy of recent years. Krauze looks closely at how these ideas have been expressed in the lives of influential revolutionaries, thinkers, poets, and novelists&#x2014;figures whose lives were marked by a passionate involvement in history, power, and, for some, revolution, as well as a personal commitment to love, friendship, and family. Krauze&#x2019;s subjects come from across the continents. Here are the Cuban Jos� Mart�; the Argentines Che Guevara and Evita Per�n; the groundbreaking political thinkers Jos� Vasconcelos of Mexico and Jos� Carlos Mari�tegui from Peru. Writers Jos� Enrique Rod�, Mario Vargas Llosa, Octavio Paz, and Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez reinforce the importance of imagination to inspire social change. </p><p><em>Redeemers</em> also highlights Mexico&#x2019;s Samuel Ruiz and Subcomandante Marcos and Venezuela&#x2019;s president Hugo Ch�vez, and their influence on contemporary Latin America. </p><p>In this brilliant and deeply researched history, Enrique Krauze uses the range of these extraordinary lives to illuminate the struggle that has defined Latin American history: an ever-precarious balance between the ideal of democracy and the temptation of political messianism. Through this comprehensive collage of the distinct but interconnected experiences and views of these twelve fascinating cultural and political figures, we can better understand how this balance continues to affect Latin America today and how its nations will define themselves and relate to the larger world in the years ahead. </p><p>Enrique Krauze is the author of twenty books, including <em>Mexico: Biography of Power</em>. He has written for <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The New Republic</em>, <em>Dissent</em> magazine, <em>The Washington Post</em>, and <em>The New York Review of Books</em>. Krauze lives in Mexico City.</p></p><h2>The Brothers Lionheart</h2><p>Two brothers share many adventures after their death when they are reunited in Nangiyala, the land where sagas come from.</p><p>The Brothers Lionheart is a remarkable book. Astrid Lindgren surely gains new stature in a probing world far removed from Pippi Longstocking -- this one is far deeper, and more demanding of courage, than any of Lindgren's previous works. Even on a surface level, the story must be her most unusual and unexpected; but what sticks in the mind are the endlessly fascinating quesions she raises. Lindgren is speculating not only on the human situation but on the very nature of what may or may nor lie very darkly beyond it. It may be unsettling, but that's exactly as it should be. <p>--Lloyd Alexander</p>Born in Sweden in 1907. During the course of her life she wrote over 40 books for children. She once commented: &#39;I write to amuse the child within me, and can only hope that other children may have some fun that way too.&#39; Many of her stories are based upon her memories of childhood, and filled with lively and unconventional characters. Perhaps the best known is Pippi Longstocking, first published in Sweden in 1945. It was an immediate success with children, and was later published in England in 1954. During her lifetime, Lindgren was awarded dozens of Swedish and international prizes for her writing, among them the prestigious Hans Christian Andersen medal in 1958. In 1989 a theme park dedicated to her - Astrid Lindgren&#39;s World - was opened in the author&#39;s home town of Vimmerby. She died in 2002.</p><h2>Radford&#39;s Stores and Flat Buildings</h2><p>Ideas for small bank buildings; store buildings; double or twin houses; and two-, four-, six- and nine-apartment buildings.

Constructions show are in stone, brick, cement, and wood.</p><p></p><h2>The Great Yellow Fleet: A History of American Railroad Refrigerator Cars</h2><p>Fascinating and well-written story of the railroad refrigerator car, beginning with the ventilated fruit car, the ice car, and the mechanical reefer and tracing the history of the railroad transportation of perishables up to the present mechanical trailers handled by piggyback. Includes extensive discussion of the four largest car lines, Merchants Despatch Transportation Co., Fruit Growers Express, Pacific Fruit Express (run by SP/UP/WP), and Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch, as well as a discussion of why private fleets developed and why railroads eventually entered the field. Provides detailed coverage of unique cars such as narrow gauge reefers, beer and wine cars, specialized cars, and the actual mechanical aspects of the cars: the trucks, the roof ice bunker, how the ice was manufactured, stored and loaded, how the cars were re-iced during transit, experiments with ammonia and silica gel to replace ice, and the development of the diesel powered mechanical reefer. Reefers profoundly changed the eating habits of the nation by allowing the crops of the south and west in the US to reach northern and eastern markets and their story is told here in fascinating detail by one of the great names in railroad history.

Robinson, a professor of Slavic studies with a particular interest in Prokofiev&#39;s operas, draws upon previously untranslated Russian documents and letters to provide an unusually rich and detailed view of this enigmatic composer. His is a &#34;warts and all&#34; treatment: though obviously sympathetic to his subject, Robinson candidly exposes Prokofiev&#39;s flaws, from his musical capriciousness and opportunism to his unpardonable social tactlessness. Prokofiev traveled widely during much of his career, and his observations on the contemporary music scene make entertaining reading.</p><p>HARLOW ROBINSON is Professor of Modern Languages and History at Northeastern University. He is the author of The Last Impresario: The Life, Times, and Legacy of Sol Hurok and the editor and translator of Selected Letters of Sergei Prokofiev, also published by Northeastern University Press. He is a contributor to the New York Times, Opera News, Dance Magazine, the Los Angeles Times, and the Metropolitan Opera-Texaco International Radio Network. He lives in the Boston area.More detailed and comprehensive, and less politically partisan, than previous biographies, this readable account by a professor of Slavic studies at the State Univ. of New York deals objectively but compassionately with the life and work of a major Russian composer whose career began like a skyrocket but ended sadly. He died in 1953, only hours before the death of his principal persecutor Joseph Stalin. An opinionated, difficult man of genius, the nonpolitical Prokofiev was inevitably caught up in the revolutionary changes that took place in his native land. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1918, to Germany in 1922, married an elegant Spanish soprano, moved on to France and became a sophisticated Parisian. When he returned with his wife and sons to the Soviet Union in 1936, he was almost immediately trapped in a situation from which he could not extricate himself. And although he wrote many works glorifying the regime, he was resented for his international past and connections, his foreign manner and arrogance. As soon as he separated from his wife, she was imprisoned "on suspicion of spying." In 1948 he married a Russian woman with whom he had been living for seven years. Almost until the day he died Prokofiev continued to be productive but was frustrated because his operas failed to win critical and popular acceptance.

This is the powerful and dramatic tale of our nation&#39;s incessant impulse to invent and discover, and of our complex relationship with the fruits of this impulse--a relationship that finds us liberated, dependent, enthusiastic, and skeptical all at once.</p><p>The book that helped earn Thomas P. Hughes his reputation as one of the foremost historians of technology of our age and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1990, <i>American Genesis</i> tells the sweeping story of America's technological revolution. Unlike other histories of technology, which focus on particular inventions like the light bulb or the automobile, <i>American Genesis</i> makes these inventions characters in a broad chronicle, both shaped by and shaping a culture. By weaving scientific and technological advancement into other cultural trends, Hughes demonstrates here the myriad ways in which the two are inexorably linked, and in a new preface, he recounts his earlier missteps in predicting the future of technology and follows its move into the information age.<b>Thomas P. Hughes </b>(1923-2014) was the Mellon Professor Emeritus in the Department of the History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania and Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship and a member of the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Hughes received honorary doctorates from Northwestern University and the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, and was a&nbsp;member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Engineering Sciences and the U.S. National Academy of Engineering.

Some will die in Christ, others will die outside of Him. None of us can know the time of our death, but we can prepare ourselves now to insure that it is a blessed one. In an exposition of Revelation 14:13, &#34;Blessed are they which die in the Lord,&#34; James Durham, a Scottish preacher from the 17th century, shows the blessedness of those who die in the Lord as well as the misery of those who reject Him. If it is blessed to die in Christ, then it must be terrible to die otherwise. Durham not only shows how such a death is blessed, and how any other death is miserable, but also shows that a failure to meditate on death and prepare for it leads to all kinds of errors and evil practices. He gives directions for dying in the Lord, shows what to do when death comes suddenly, and then shows all of a believer&#39;s comforts in death.</p><p>James Durham (1622-1658) <p>James Durham was the eldest son of John Durham. He studied at St. Andrew&#x2019;s University, and afterwards lived the life of a "country gentleman." He was captain of a troop in the civil war, and while praying publicly with his troop was overheard by David Dickson, who thought he must be a chaplain because of his prayer. Dickson, a prominent Presbyterian divine, successfully encouraged Durham to pursue the ministry. </p><p>After studying at Glasgow University, he was licensed to preach in 1647, and in 1650 was appointed professor of divinity at the university. He was soon appointed as chaplain to the king. He was called to the ministry in Glasgow (St. Mungo&#x2019;s), where he ministered until his death in 1658. </p><p>Durham died at the age of 36. His sermons on Revelation have been published by Old Paths Publications. The last work he wrote, The Dying Man&#x2019;s Testament to the Church of Scotland, or A Treatise Concerning Scandal, has been published by Napthali Press.</p></p><h2>How To Open Locks With Improvised Tools: Practical, Non-Destructive Ways Of Getting Back Into Just About Everything When You Lose Your Keys (formerly published as Lock Bypass Methods)</h2><p>Practical, real-world solutions to lockouts. Learn to open doorknobs, deadbolts, car doors, padlocks, handcuffs, et cetera. This book sold out as "Lock Bypass Methods," and has proven to be the best manual on keyless entry available. Since your resources are usually on the other side of the door when you're locked out, it shows how to improvise tools from garbage and common, everday items. Multiple entrance options are provided in case of stubborn doors or limited materials. Thousands of people have successfully opened doors using techniques they learned in "Lock Bypass Methods." This expanded edition has more illustrations and new techniques. <p>This book will not waste your time trying to explain how to pick sidebar locks, or activate magnetic-stripe readers without a key card. It DOES explain how to open doors protected by these locks, simply and without damage, through bypass techniques. A latch holds something shut, and a lock is a gateway to that latch. This book teaches ways to climb over the fence and ignore the gate. You will learn how to pick locks, a skill that works 60-70% of the time. More importantly, you will learn methods to trip actuators, move linkage rods, take advantage of mechanical design flaws, exploit tolerances in a lock's setting, and other practical means of entry. </p><p>The book's focus is on problem solving, not presenting methods that are too difficult to accomplish. Many other books in this field suffer from too much theory and too little delivery. If it doesn't work, it isn't in here. This book is designed to give the reader skills that open locks without keys or damage. It is not a whitewashed or glossed-over set of instructions that leave a reader feeling as if failure is his fault and he just hasn't developed some special esoteric talent. Difficulties encountered in opening methods are identified, explained, and solutions are given to cope with them. The book is clearly written and illustrated, and covers problem solving, how locks work, picking, bypassing, and tool making. If you are interested in opening locks without keys, you should have this book.</p></p><p>Hans Conkel has been involved in locksmithing since 1994.

But Anne has failed to give the king an heir, and Cromwell watches as Henry falls for plain Jane Seymour. Cromwell must find a solution that will satisfy Henry, safeguard the nation and secure his own career. But neither minister nor king will emerge unscathed from the bloody theatre of Anne s final days.</p><p>An astounding literary accomplishment, Bring Up the Bodies is the story of this most terrifying moment of history, by one of our greatest living novelists.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Hilary Mantel on How She Wrote <em>Bring Up the Bodies</em></strong> <br> <p> </p> <p><strong>Origins of the Book</strong></p> <p><em>Bring Up the Bodies</em> is the second part of my trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to Henry VIII. I have been interested in Cromwell for years, and wanted to get beyond the negative portrayal of him in popular history and fiction. He was a ruthless man, certainly, but no more so than other contemporary politicians; and in Henry, a man of violent temper, he had a very demanding employer. As soon as you get back beyond the prejudices about Cromwell, you find a clever, enterprising, resilient and optimistic man, with a story well worth telling. He was at the center of Henry's court for almost ten years, and when you look at events from his point of view, they seem very different from the stories of the Tudor court to which we've grown accustomed. </p> <p>Originally I thought I would tell the story in just one book. But as I made progress with <em>Wolf Hall</em>, I discovered the richness and depth of the material. I was glad to alter my plans. Now the project will reach a conclusion in <em>The Mirror &amp; The Light</em>, the book that is still ahead of me.</p> <p><strong>How is it different from <em>Wolf Hall</em>?</strong></p> <p><em>Wolf Hall</em> takes in a huge span of time, describing Cromwell's early life, and reaching back into the previous century, to show the forces that shaped England before he was born. The foreground action of the book occupies several years, ending in July 1535, on the day of the execution of Cromwell's political antagonist, Thomas More.</p> <p>The action of <em>Bring Up The Bodies</em> occupies only nine months, and within that nine months it concentrates on the three weeks in which Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn, is arrested, tried and executed for treason. So it is a shorter, more concentrated read. There are no diversions once the plot against Anne begins to accelerate, and the tension builds as her death approaches.</p> <p>It's quite possible to read <em>Bring Up The Bodies</em> without reading <em>Wolf Hall</em>. It makes sense in its own terms. But I think a reader will get a deeper experience by starting with the first book and seeing the characters evolve.</p> <br> <p><strong>Space: What's on your desk, in your office, on the walls, outside your window? Describe your writing space. Where do you go when you can't write there?</strong></p> <p>My office is in my apartment on the East Devon coast. Before my desk there is a big window, and beyond that a shingle beach and the sea. On my large pine desk there's just my laptop, my working papers, and my diary, plus a silver dial that tells the time in the world's major cities. I have a mouse mat with the Holbein image of Thomas Cromwell on it; my husband magicked this up from somewhere. I keep my pens and markers in a china pot with a picture of Henry VIII, which came from the National Portrait Gallery in London. On my left there is a whiteboard which I use to plan each chapter as I write, and also to scribble down any fleeting thoughts; if I'm elsewhere in the apartment it's the whiteboard I run to, to catch a phrase I'm afraid might slip away. I can write anywhere, though; I long ago learned to write and polish a paragraph in my head. And I do a lot of work in my notebooks when I'm travelling, shuttling up to London on the train. I write in the car too; in the passenger seat, I should add.</p> <p><strong>Soundtrack: What/who do you listen to? Why? How? (headphones, computer, radio?)</strong></p> <p>I can hear the sea. Nothing else is as good as that. Noise doesn't distract me, necessarily, but if I put on music I quickly blank it out. </p> <p><strong>Tools: Pens? Notebook? Computer (Mac or PC)? Special software?</strong></p> <p>Most of my work originates in longhand. I like writing by hand but I have 2 sorts of handwriting; one is quite decorative, and the other is as plain as possible and as legible as possible, my note-taking hand which I use when I copy from a document. At a certain stage I rip up my notebooks and shuffle the pages into some sort of order in ring-binders; from those I work straight on to my pc. I&#x2019;ve been writing on the screen since 1986, at which point I was into my third book. But I'm old enough to remember the toil in the days of typewriters and messy, smudgy carbon copies.</p> <p><strong>Words: What are you reading? Do you read anyone to prime the pump, so to speak? Or to escape your own writing?</strong></p> <p>On the whole I prefer not to read fiction when I'm hard at work on my own writing, because I find it difficult to make the commitment a novel requires, to enter into someone els's imaginary world.

Brave and beautiful Brynn Dharielle sets out on a daring mission to free her beloved homeland from tyrannical rule. But she cannot imagine the depth of chaos, corruption, and betrayal that seethes admist a ruthless sect of warrior priests, led and manipulated by an evil chieftain who conceals a dark, age-old secret.<br><br>For Brynn and her trusted elven companion, the way to Behren turns into a fierce and illuminating voyage beneath the Belt-and-Buckle mountains. And while they face many dangers, the knowledge they acquire will have profound implications for the future of the elven valley, a land shaped by the plotting of a queen desperate to hold onto her magic. <br><br>Meanwhile, by the time Brynn reaches the land where she once saw her parents murdered, the seeds of revolution are already flourishing. For a courageous young woman and her elven mentor, the first salvo of a sweeping battle has begun&#x2014;one that will threaten to destroy the heart and soul of their world.<br><br>The eagerly anticipated new novel in R. A. Salvatore&#x2019;s Second DemonWars saga, <i>Transcendence</i> is an extraordinary adventure that introduces a remarkable new hero&#x2014;and explores the mysteries of enlightenment and the art of war . . . in a dazzling epic of the imagination.</p><p>In <i>Transcendence</i>, the second book in his second DemonWars Saga, author R.A. Salvatore adds another layer to the events of book one, <i>Ascendance</i>, with a parallel plot line in the desert kingdom of Behren. He spotlights the Elven-trained Ranger Brynn Dharielle as she quests to claim her birthright and free the nomadic To-gai from the theocratic occupation of Behren and its dark kingpriest--Yakim Douan. <p> <i>Transcendence</i> is as much the story of Brynn's quest to free the oppressed To-gai as it is the tale of their oppressors. While events in <i>Ascendance</i> are heating up, <i>Transcendence</i> introduces the Yatol leader Douan who is single-mindedly preparing for his, yes, "transcendence" wherein the leader will die to be reborn. It's the secret behind this miracle and Douan's machinations to secure his lands in preparation for the rebirth that will eventually allow Brynn to free the To-gai from the Behrenese yoke. But Brynn's quest will unleash the deadly power of an ancient ally who will test her resolve to win her people's freedom.</p><p> <i>Transcendence</i> is excellent fantasy. Salvatore's characters stride across a grand stage that is epic in scale yet still detailed and personal. The juxtaposition of happenings in the first two books sets up what will be a thrilling conclusion as the political implications of each will undoubtedly collide in book three. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p><b>R.

But then comes the horrifying twist: Her young son was asleep in the back seat, and he has now disappeared into the night.<br><br>So begins Richard Price's electrifying new novel, a tale set on the same turf--Dempsey, New Jersey--as <i>Clockers.</i> Assigned to investigate the case of Brenda Martin's missing child is detective Lorenzo Council, a local son of the very housing project targeted as the scene of the crime. Under a white-hot media glare, Lorenzo launches an all-out search for the abducted boy, even as he quietly explores a different possibility: Does Brenda Martin know a lot more about her son's disappearance than she's admitting?<br><br>Right behind Lorenzo is Jesse Haus, an ambitious young reporter from the city's evening paper. Almost immediately, Jesse suspects Brenda of hiding something. Relentlessly, she works her way into the distraught mother's fragile world, befriending her even as she looks for the chance to break the biggest story of her career.<br><br>As the search for the alleged carjacker intensifies, so does the simmering racial tension between Dempsey and its mostly white neighbor, Gannon. And when the Gannon police arrest a black man from Dempsey and declare him a suspect, the animosity between the two cities threatens to boil over into violence. With the media swarming and the mood turning increasingly ugly, Lorenzo must take desperate measures to get to the bottom of Brenda Martin's story.<br><br>At once a suspenseful mystery and a brilliant portrait of two cities locked in a death-grip of explosive rage, <i>Freedomland</i> reveals the heart of the urban American experience--dislocated, furious, yearning--as never before. Richard Price has created a vibrant, gut-wrenching masterpiece whose images will remain long after the final, devastating pages.</p><p>In <i>Freedomland</i>, Richard Price returns to the gritty terrain he first explored in <i>Clockers</i>. This time, the fictional (but all too convincing) urban eyesore of Dempsy, New Jersey, is convulsed by a high-profile carjacking. A single mom named Brenda Martin insists that a man stopped her car, yanked her from behind the wheel, and drove off with the vehicle--and her young son. Behind these horrific facts looms another: the victim is white and the perpetrator is black. Immediately the racial calculus of American life comes to bear on the crime, which becomes a focus for long-smoldering animosities. As a three-ring circus of media, cops, and gawkers converges on the crime scene, Dempsy and the adjoining white community of Gannon seem primed for an explosion. Price passes the narrative baton back and forth between Lorenzo Council, an ambitious black detective, and Jesse Haus, a no-less-ambitious reporter for the local paper. Lorenzo's street-smart, agitated voice is the more convincing of the two. Jesse, with her frantic compulsion to squeeze local color from the crisis, never quite attains three dimensions--although her outsider's relationship to her material suggests some faint, fascinating echo of the author's. In any case, Price allows the story to proceed at an irresistible slow burn. His ear for dialogue is as sharp as ever, and nobody casts a colder or more accurate eye on our fin-de-si�cle urban existence."A big, cinemascope thriller, a novel that captures the racial politics and media madness of the Age of O.J., a novel that transforms today's headlines into a forceful, harrowing drama....a terrific read...Price has written his most powerful novel yet."<br>--Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times</i><p> Praise for Richard Price and his work:</p><p>"Price shows that he's got the best equipment a novelist can have--that combination of muscularity, insight, and compassion we might call heart."<br><i>--Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>"Price pressure cooks the city down to its dense, searing essentials."<br><i>--Village Voice Literary Supplement</i></p><p>"Powerful...harrowing...a drama of quite remarkable complexity."<br>--the <i>New York Times</i> on <i>Clockers</i></p><p>"<i>Clockers</i> is a great piece of work."<br>--Tom Wolfe</p></p><h2>The Best of Croatian Cooking (Hippocrene International Cookbooks)</h2><p>Croatia, a beautiful and geographically diverse country on Europe&#39;s Balkan peninsula, offers sunny Adriatic coastline and breathtaking scenery, and a distinctive culinary tradition which combines central European, Mediterranean and Near Eastern influences.

You will discover its impetus, its motive, its little research tricks, its blinding flashes of lexicographic insight and the way the writer, straining to show how language illuminates The Meaning of Life, settles for the meaning of a word.</p> <p><i>1. Glom onto a vogue word just as it passes its peak.</i></p> <p>"White House Finds <i>'Fast Track'</i> Too Slippery" was the <i>Washington Post</i> headline over a story by Peter Baker. His lead: "Attention White House speechwriters: The term <i>fast track</i> is no longer in vogue." As the drive for free-trade legislation began, the phrase of choice was "Renewal of Traditional Trading Authority."</p> <p>Just as many of you were getting your engines steamed up to take the <i>fast track,</i> your track gets renamed. Why?</p> <p><i>"Fast-track</i> legislation" made its burst for fame in the mid-70s as Congress gave the President a right that stretched to twenty years to negotiate trade treaties with other nations without having to face amendments back home; as a result, subsequent treaties would be ratified or turned down, all-er-nuthin'. Robert Cassidy, a lawyer who helped draft the Trade Act of 1974, recalls the adjective surfacing toward the end of the Tokyo Round in the late 70s; it did not appear in legislation until 1988.</p> <p>When presidential authority to zip a treaty through expired, a Republican Congress was not so eager to hand that power back to Democrat Clinton. That's the reason White House wordmeisters derailed the use of <i>fast track</i> (too hasty-sounding) in favor of the solid, stodgy, nothing-new-here "Renewal of Traditional Trading Authority," as if George Washington had been born with the old <i>fast track</i> in his crib.</p> <p><i>2. Involve the reader.</i></p> <p>Here is a postcard from a slum dweller in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, with an incomprehensible scrawl for a name asking: "What's with <i>fast track?</i> Whatever happened to 'life in the fast lane'?"</p> <p>Now our linguistic train begins to leave the station, and we</p> <p><i>3. Follow the usage trail.</i></p> <p>The <i>fast lane</i> comes from auto racing. The trusty <i>Oxford English Dictionary,</i> supplemented and on CD-ROM, has a 1966 citation from Thomas Henry Wisdom's <i>High Performance Driving:</i> "One is frustrated on a motorway by the driver ahead in the <i>fast lane</i> (if only he understood it is the overtaking lane)."</p> <p>How did the term get popularized in its metaphorically broadened form? A 1972 novel by Douglas Rutherford was titled <i>Clear the Fast Lane,</i> but that was still about auto racing. Then, in 1976, a rock group named the Eagles put out an album, <i>Hotel California,</i> that included the single "Life in the Fast Lane" by Joe Walsh, Don Henley and Glenn Frey.</p> <p>"They knew all the right people/They took all the right pills/They threw outrageous parties/They paid heavenly bills/There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face/She pretended not to notice she was caught up in the race...." The chorus: "Life in the <i>fast lane</i>/Surely make you lose your mind...."</p> <p>Since that song, the <i>fast lane</i> has had overtones of the drug culture and impending disaster, a speeded-up, sinister, modern version of Shakespeare's "primrose path of dalliance."</p> <p>At this point, the language columnist thinks he has come to the fundament of it all, fulfilling his obligation to</p> <p><i>4. Satisfy the slavering etymological urge in roots-deprived readers.</i></p> <p>We have seen the OED make clear that the derivation is from highway driving. In Britain, the <i>fast lane</i> is the overtaking lane; in the United States, it is usually officially called the "passing lane." And as <i>fast lane</i> was being adopted, it spawned, or influenced, <i>fast track.</i></p> <p>Not so fast. The phrase <i>fast track</i> has a long history in horse racing, to mean "dry, conducive to speed." On the other hand, if it has been raining, the wet track is described as "slow," and the touts race about urging you to put your money on a "mudder," a horse that digs slogging. Count on some reader to find a metaphoric extension of <i>fast track</i> in a Jane Austen or Henry James novel.</p> <p>Nor is that the only untapped root. Soon the vast legion of railroad buffs will check in with yards of lore about fast railroad tracks, where expresses roar past with whistles in the night.</p> <p>I remember Richard Nixon using <i>fast track</i> in 1964, after he moved to New York City following his defeat for California governor. He told <i>The New York Times</i> a year later: "New York is a place where you can't slow down -- a <i>fast track.</i> Any person tends to vegetate unless he is moving on a <i>fast track."</i></p> <p>And so the column falls together, requiring the writer only to</p> <p><i>5. Leave with a snapper, or sometimes a peroration.</i></p> <p>When next you hear of Congress disputing the president's bid for <i>fast-track</i> authority, think of the well-mentored business executives and political loners on the rise, following the racing drivers careening around the speedways, following the jockeys booting their mounts home on a sunny day, following John Luther (Casey) Jones, the hero engineer, slamming on the brakes and giving up his life to save his passengers from death on the <i>fast track.</i></p> <p>Copyright � 2003 by The Cobbett Corporation</p> <p><b>Achilles' Heels</b></p> <p>The legal columnist Bruce Fein of <i>The Washington Times,</i> attacking the attacker-attackers who have been blasting his friend Ken Starr, expressed astonishment at "mass-media gullibility in peddling bogus portraits of the Whitewater independent counsel sold by <i>myrmidons</i> of President Clinton."</p> <p>What's a <i>myrmidon?</i> The poet Homer, often caught nodding but now probably shaking his head at the Clintonian odyssey, would point us to the <i>Myrmidones,</i> an Achaean race in Thessaly, Greece, who fought under Achilles in the Trojan War. They assumed their ancestor to be the issue of the mating of Zeus with Eurymedusa, a woman wooed by the god when he took the shape of an ant. (Some wags suggest that this may have been the origin of "ants in the pants.")</p> <p>An alternative mythic source is the changing of ants into men by Zeus in answer to the prayers of King Aeacus, who had lost his army to the plague. But the metaphoric intent is the same, describing a race of antlike men, and the meaning of <i>myrmidon,</i> which should not be capitalized in its extended meaning, is "slavish follower; subordinate who obeys the orders of his leader without mercy."</p> <p>The Greek word was introduced into American politics by Alexander Hamilton in his efforts to block Aaron Burr from becoming president in 1800. Hamilton wrote to Gouverneur Morris that Burr, to accomplish his end, "must lean upon unprincipled men, and will continue to adhere to the <i>myrmidons</i> who have hitherto surrounded him."</p> <p>One man's <i>myrmidon,</i> however, is another man's <i>die-hard.</i></p> <p></p> <b>ACRONYMANIA</b> <p>In South Africa, an organization that hands out free condoms to prostitutes calls itself the Sex Worker Education and Advocacy Taskforce (Sweat).</p> <p>In Chicago, an antidrug outfit calls itself Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity (Crack).</p> <p>Serious business should eschew jazzy acronyms. Time for Citizens Militant on Nomenclature (C'MON).</p> <p></p> <b>ADVENTURER</b> <p>The word <i>adventurer</i> has been through a half-millennium of exciting times.</p> <p>Disrepute was its cradle. The Latin <i>advenir</i> meant "come to," as in "come to pass; arrive, happen," and a vestige lingers in gambling lingo as "betting on the come" in the hope that what will come next will enable the gambling <i>adventurer</i> to win. <i>Adventure</i> meant "coming by chance; the luck of the draw."</p> <p>Applied to a person, <i>adventurer</i> meant "gamester," what we would now call "gambler." Accordingly, an English ordinance in 1474 decreed that the royal household would bar the "swearer, brawler, backbyter" and <i>"adventorer."</i> Five centuries ago the <i>adventorer</i> was a fit companion for the secretive <i>backbyter,</i> the calumniator who whispered his slanders, stabbing reputations in the back.</p> <p>Gambling and war combined as soldiers of fortune bet their lives on their livelihood; a 1555 usage derided "our <i>adventurers,</i> that serve withoute wages," supported only by their plunder. Just seven years before that, Edward Hall in his <i>Chronicle</i> provided the etymology: "He gave them a Pennon of St. George and bade them, Adventure (of whiche they were called <i>Adventurers)."</i> Most soldiers of fortune were self-glorified brigands; to be called an <i>adventurer</i> was to be insulted.</p> <p>Then the pejorative word had a run of good luck. John Milton, in his 1667 <i>Paradise Lost,</i> wrote of "the Heav'n-banished host" of fallen angels awaiting the return of their satanic leader "now expecting/Each hour their great <i>adventurer</i> from the search/Of foreign worlds." (Though devilish, Lucifer was "great.") Meanwhile, a commercial company was founded in Antwerp and chartered in England called the Merchant <i>Adventurers,</i> in the sense of "enterprise," and led in the exploration and colonization of North America. The hazard to be undertaken was no longer a time-wasting game but a dangerous journey, an exploration for riches or a moral crusade. Jonathan Swift wrote in his <i>Tale of a Tub</i> (1704) "to encourage all aspiring <i>adventurers."</i></p> <p>But then it was applied to Prince Charles Edward Stuart in the pretender's desperate insurrection of 1745; his sobriquet was "the Young <i>Adventurer."</i> Then adventuring became an -ism and lost even more respect. An English review in 1843 lumped together "Concubinage, Socialism and <i>Adventurism,"</i> scorning all three as evidence of social decline. The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> defined it as "the principles and practice of an <i>adventurer</i> or <i>adventuress;</i> defiance of the ordinary canons of social decorum." An adventuress, especially, was not just a kept woman but was stigmatized as "loose."</p> <p>Worse, <i>adventurism </i></p></p><h2>The Frogs Wore Red Suspenders</h2><p><p>Jack Prelutsky is the undisputed master of hilarious verse for the youngest child.

The possibility of life on the planet was an obsession in the 19th century. It is not surprising to find that it has become so once again, because of all the planets in the solar system (apart from Earth), Mars has always been regarded as the most likely to serve as the abode of life. Now that there are hints that the planet may have held &#34;liquid water&#34; (a prerequisite for life, in contrast to the frozen water of the ice caps) much more recently than anyone had supposed, excitement over Mars exploration has never been higher.In this engaging, eloquent account of our love affair with the Red Planet, William Sheehan and Stephen James O&#39;Meara review the history of human fascination with our neighbor in the solar system, and look at the prospects for manned spaceflight to Mars in this new century. The authors portray the history of Mars investigations through the eyes of the dreamers and achievers that have made the planet such an integral part of the human psyche. They reveal the discoverers&#39; hardships, their strength in the face of criticisms, and the glories of their successes.What Everest and the moon were to the 20th century, Mars will be to the 21st. Mars is our Everest, a new frontier that will continue to spur the greatest flights of imagination and the most astounding technical feats. Projects are already underway to make these dreams a reality. This book will prepare you and fill you with enthusiasm for the adventure ahead.</p><p>William Sheehan (Willmar, MN) is author of The Planet Mars and the co-author of In Search of Planet Vulcan. Stephen James O'Meara (Volcano, HI) is the author of the Deep-Sky Companions series. Both Sheehan and O'Meara are contributing editors to Sky &amp; Telescope and Odyssey magazines.The authors, both contributing editors to Sky &amp; Telescope magazine, note that "On the eve of a new wave of space missions designed to search for water on Mars, it remains possible that even now `the Mars we are trying to explore does not exist,' " t hereby encapsulating what may be the book's fatal flaw. Mars chronicles humanity's long fascination with the eponymous planet, from the Australian Aborigines' Dreamtime, an element of their culture that has been passed down for more than 40,000 years through Ptolemy and Copernicus, Kepler and Brahe, to the mapping of Mars via telescope and probes, Percival Lowell's canal theories and their subsequent dismantling by fact, and the great search for water and life. The problem is, Mars can't live up to its myth. The more we learn, the more there is for us to learn; we also discover that Mars is nothing like the planet of Burroughs, Bradbury and War of the Worlds (to which the authors devote a chapter), tinging our discoveries with disappointment. Two of the many pictures the authors include reinforce this. As affecting as the shot taken from the planet's rocky surface by Sojourner is, it's difficult not to be disillusioned by the shot of Carl Sagan standing next to a lander in the desert on Earth the two landscapes are so similar. The authors try to keep hope alive by discussing the possibility of life on Mars, but simple bacteria, even if they did exist there, can't compare to little green men. So here is Mars as it is, but not as you may want it. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The San Francisco Century: A City Rises from the Ruins of the 1906 Earthquake and Fire</h2><p><b>The city's miraculous emergence from the devastating earthquake of 1906 unveils the fascinating people, history, and culture that have made the past 100 years in San Francisco an extraordinary American adventure.</b><br><br>It's fitting that San Francisco's city seal features a phoenix; the city itself was reborn from the ashes of the Great Earthquake of 1906.

His books have been widely translated and his famous series has been developed into two television series shown in 24 countries. Winston Graham was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and in 1983 was awarded the OBE.<p>From Chapter 1</p> <p>There could have been prophecy in the storm that blew up at the time of Julia's birth.</p> <p>May month was not a time for heavy gales, but the climate of Cornwall is capri�cious as any child ever born. It had been a kindly enough spring, as kindly as the summer and winter that had gone before it; mild, soft, comfortable weather; and the land was already heavy with green things. Then May broke rainy and gusty, and the blossom suffered here and there and the hay leaned about looking for support.</p> <p>On the night of the fifteenth, Demelza felt her first pains. Even then for a while she gripped the bedpost and thought the matter all round before she said anything. All along she had viewed the coming ordeal with a calm and philosophical mind and had never troubled Ross with false alarms. She did not want to begin so late. Last evening she had been out in her beloved garden, digging round the young plants; then as it was going dark she had found a disgruntled hedgehog and had played with him, trying to persuade him to take some bread and milk, and had only come in reluctantly as the sky clouded and it went cold.</p> <p>This now-this thing in the middle of the night-might yet be only the result of getting overtired.</p> <p>But when it began to feel as if someone was kneeling on her backbone and trying to break it, she knew it was not.</p> <p>She touched Ross's arm and he woke instantly.</p> <p>"Well?"</p> <p>"I think," she said, "I think you will have to fetch Prudie."</p> <p>He sat up. "Why? What is it?"</p> <p>"I have a pain."</p> <p>"Where? Do you mean..."</p> <p>"I have a pain," she said primly. "I think twould be as well to fetch Prudie."</p> <p>He climbed quickly out of bed, and she listened to the scratch of flint and steel. After a moment the tinder caught and he lit a candle. The room flickered into view: heavy teak beams, the curtain over the door moving gently in the breeze, the low window seat hung with pink grogram, her shoes as she had kicked them off, one wooden sole upmost, Joshua's spyglass, Ross's pipe, Ross's book, and a fly crawling.</p> <p>He looked at her and at once knew the truth. She smiled a pallid apology. He went across to the table by the door and poured her a glass of brandy.</p> <p>"Drink this. I will send Jud for Dr. Choake." He began to pull on his clothes, anyhow.</p> <p>"No, no, Ross; do not send yet. It is the middle of the night. He will be asleep."</p> <p>Whether Thomas Choake should be called in to her had been a dissension between them for some weeks. Demelza could not forget that twelve months ago she had been a maidservant and that Choake, though only a physician, owned a small estate which, even if it had been bought with his wife's money, put him on a level from which the likes of her would be seen as unimportant chattels. That was until Ross married her. Since then she had grown to her position. She could put on a show of refinement and good manners, and not at all a bad show at that, but a doctor was different. A doctor caught one at a disadvantage. If the pain was bad, she would almost certainly swear in the old way she had learned from her father, not a few genteel "damn mes" and "by Gods," as anyone might excuse from a lady in trouble. To have a baby and be forced to act genteel at the same time was more than Demelza could look forward to.</p> <p>Besides, she didn't want a man about. It wasn't decent. Her cousin-in-law, Elizabeth, had had him, but Elizabeth was an aristocrat born and bred, and they looked at things different. <i>She </i>would far rather have had old Aunt Betsy Triggs from Mellin, who sold pilchards and was a rare strong hand when it came to babies.</p> <p>But Ross was the more determined and he had had his way. She was not unprepared for his curt, "Then he shall be woke," as he left the room.</p> <p><i>"Ross!" </i>She called him back. For the moment the pain had gone.</p> <p>"Yes?" His strong, scarred, introspective face was half lit by the candle; the upgrowing dark hair was ruffled and hardly showed its hint of copper; his shirt was open at the throat. This man...aristocrat of them all, she thought...this man, so reserved and reserving, with whom she had shared rare intimacy.</p> <p>"Would you?" she said. "Before you go..."</p> <p>He came back to the bed. The emergency had come on him so quickly in his sleep that he had had no time yet to feel anything but alarm that her time was here and relief that it might soon be over. As he kissed her he saw the moisture on her face and a worm of fear and compassion moved in him. He took her face in his hands, pushed back the black hair, and stared a moment into the dark eyes of his young wife. They were not dancing and mischievous as they so often were, but there was no fear in them.</p> <p>"I'll be back. In a moment I'll be back."</p> <p>She made a gesture of dissent. "Don't come back, Ross. Go and tell Prudie, that's all. I'd rather-you didn't see me like this."</p> <p>"And what of Verity? You specially wanted Verity here."</p> <p>"Tell her in the morning. Tisn't fair to bring her out in the night air. Send for her in the morning."</p> <p>He kissed her again.</p> <p>"Tell me that you love me, Ross," she said.</p> <p>He looked at her in surprise.</p> <p>"You know I do!"</p> <p>"And say you don't love Elizabeth."</p> <p>"And I don't love Elizabeth." What else was he to say when he did not know the truth himself? He was not a man who spoke his inmost feelings easily, but now he saw himself powerless to help her, and only words of his and not actions would give her aid. "Nothing else matters but you," he said. "Remember that. All my relatives and friends-and Elizabeth, and this house and the mine...I'd throw them in the dust and you know it-and you know it. If you don't know it, then all these months I've failed and no words I can give you now will make it otherwise. I love you, Demelza, and we've had such happiness. And we're going to have it again. Take hold of that, my sweet. Hold it and keep it, for no one else can."</p> <p>"I'll hold it, Ross," she said, content because the words had come.</p> <p>He kissed her again and turned and lit more candles, took up one, and went quickly out of the room, the hot grease running over his hand. The wind had dropped since yesterday; there was only a breeze. He did not know the time, but it felt about two.</p> <p>He pushed open the door on the other side of the landing and went across to the bedroom where Jud and Prudie slept. The ill-fitting bedroom door opened with a long squeak, which merged into Prudie's slow rasping snore. He grunted in disgust, for the hot, close, sweaty smell offended his nose. The night air might be dangerous, but they could surely open the window during the day and let this stink out.</p> <p>He went across and parted the curtains and shook Jud by the shoulders. Jud's two great teeth showed like gravestones. He shook again, violently. Jud's nightcap came off and a spot of the candle grease fell on his bald patch. Jud woke. He began to curse; then he saw who it was and sat up rubbing his head.</p> <p>"What's amiss?"</p> <p>"Demelza is ill." How call her anything but Demelza to a man who had been here when she came as a tattered waif of thirteen? "I want you to go for Dr. Choake at once. And wake Prudie. She will be wanted too."</p> <p>"What's amiss with her?"</p> <p>"Her pains have begun." </p></p><h2>Understanding the Golf Swing: Today&#39;s Leading Proponents of Ernest Jones&#39; Swing Principles Presents a Complete System for Better Golf</h2><p>For the first time in paperback, this modern classic of golf instruction by renowned teacher Manuel de la Torre (the 1986 PGA Teacher of the Year and the #11 teacher in America as ranked by the editors of Golf Digest in 2007) presents a simpler approach to the golf swing based on Ernest Jones&#x2019; principles. Understanding the Golf Swing includes information on the philosophy of the golf swing (with emphasis on the development of a true swinging motion), the most thorough analysis of ball flights available, and analysis of the principles of special shot play (including sand play, pitching, chipping, putting, and playing unusual shots) and the mental side of golf and effective course management.

He is typically described as today&#x2019;s leading authority on the Swing Principles&#x2019; method of instruction developed by the legendary golf instructor Ernest Jones. Manuel de la Torre has been celebrated throughout his 50 year career as a passionate keeper of the golf instructional wisdom presented and made popular in the 1930s and 1940s by Ernest Jones. In fact, Manuel&#x2019;s father. Angel de la Torre, himself the two-time Spanish Open golf champion, had met Ernest Jones at a tournament in England. When the two families settled in America Ernest Jones and Angel de la Torre became lifetime friends. Manuel literally grew up discussing the golf swing with his father and one of the games most celebrated instructors. These historical elements are presented in several meaningful appendices, including Manuel&#x2019;s moving essay on the experience of leaving his homeland Spain as civil war broke out in 1936. Manuel de la Torre was head golf profesional at the Milwaukee Country Club from 1951 to 1996. Manuel continues to conduct seminars for teaching professionals at the local, state and national levels. He lives in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<b>Manuel de la Torre</b> is a legend among golf teachers and a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. The leading proponent of Ernest Jones&#x2019;s swing principles, Manuel was head professional at Milwaukee Country Club from 1951 to 1996. He was PGA Teacher of the Year in 1986 and a four-time Wisconsin Professional of the Year. He was ranked #11 among American golf teachers by the editors of <i>Golf Digest</i> in 2007.

She is a fourth-generation Californian.</p>A luscious but dim-witted Highlands lassie and her irritatingly officious "border lord" squabble their way to true love in this trying romance set in 1580s Scotland. Sir Adam Douglas misunderstands the innocent flirtation of Mary Kate MacPherson and climbs through her bedroom window for a late-night visit. Just as he realizes he's mixed his signals, she wallops him on the head with a five-foot pole. His response is to ask Mary Kate's father for her hand; her father agrees, and Mary Kate gets her orders to marry. But then, orders pass for normal conversation here: when Mary Kate argues with Adam, he rides off andpk abandons her to walk five miles to her father's house; when she arrives, exhausted and filthy, her father "burst into laughter. . . . Douglas, too, was grinning." The reader is dragged through more such unpleasant scenes as Mary Kate repeatedly challenges Adam, is bested and humiliated, and invariably succumbs to his point of view. Insubstantial historical intrigue (surrounding the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots) adds no excitement.

Drawing largely on original documents, he analyzes the management of fires, predators, elk, bear, and other natural phenomena in such parks as the Grand Canyon, Yosemite Valley, the Teton Mountains, and of course Yellowstone itself. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>A dry but useful academic study of misguided federal resource management and ecological experimentation. ``Nature preservation--especially that requiring a thorough scientific understanding of the resources intended for preservation--is an aspect of park operations in which the [National Park] Service has advanced in a reluctant, vacillating way,'' writes Sellars, a historian with the Park Service. More directly put, his study shows how the Park Service has throughout its existence allowed the preservation of endangered species and habitats to be governed by changes in administrations and political styles. Charged with the divided mission of maximizing ``recreational tourism and public enjoyment of majestic landscapes'' on the one hand, and keeping undisturbed large sections of wild land on the other, the service has generally favored the first, putting science in the backseat. Among Sellars's cases in point is a scientific survey in Yellowstone National Park that involved marking grizzly bears' ears with colored tags, a survey halted in part because tourists complained about the bears' odd appearance. He goes on to charge that as the Park Service grows in size, its ranks are increasingly filled with part-timers and ``technicians,'' not with dedicated scientists who can train the government's resources on analyzing the ecosystems under its charge. Regrettably, many of his most interesting observations are buried in his endnotes, in which he tells, among other tidbits, the story of the Park Service's transferring a mountain in Colorado to the Forest Service after a rock slide altered its face and, presumably, obliterated its scenic grandeur. Sellars does not make the reader's task an easy or pleasant one--a shame, because he has much to say to those interested in the way national resources are managed. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Mandated to preserve and protect our historic and natural treasures, the National Park Service (NPS), Sellars contends, has disregarded a policy of scientific management of park resources from the birth of Yellowstone in 1872 until the present. A historian with the service, Sellars employs his own observations as well as a vast array of sources, including files and conversations with fellow employees and retirees to present a history of the NPS's policy conundrum between traditional tourism management and growing ecological concerns. He describes how in the early days a bureau of landscape architects and engineers maintained a natural facade of beauty obedient to a philosophy of recreational tourism inculcated by initial directors Horace Albright and Stephen Mather. In recent years, a host of scientists have fought their way into the ranks of decision makers and have stimulated a management ethic based on research, which, as Sellars skillfully points out, the NPS has not yet institutionalized.

He lives in nearby Granbury with his family.Chapter 1<br><br>////// Baalkpan, Borno Capital of the United Homes and Headquarters of the Grand Alliance November 29, 1944<br><br>It was a bright, gloriously clear, and pleasantly dry afternoon when Commander Alan Letts, Chairman of the United Homes and currently the entire Grand Alliance, came down to the waterfront to watch their latest achievement, the light cruiser USS Fitzhugh Gray (CL-1), return to port after her high-speed trials. Accompanying him was Surgeon Commander Karen Theimer Letts and all their children (one human and two adopted Lemurian war orphans); Commander Steve Riggs, who was Minister of Communications and Electrical Contrivances, and Henry Stokes, the director of the office of strategic intelligence. A Lemurian aide supported a broad, colorful parasol above them, at Karen's insistence, to protect her husband's sensitive skin. He "sloughed off skin like a snake," in her words, when he burned.<br><br>Dozens of Lemurian ministers were there as well, as was almost every member of the legislative assembly representing the various Homes, or "states," in the Union. Their furry pelts and wide, bright eyes were as multicolored as the parasol. Most strongly supported Alan as chairman, as did the vast majority of the Union population, but Alan understood and even sympathized with the fact that, with the war increasingly distant, a disconnected weariness was beginning to set in. That couldn't be allowed to take deep root, because the war was in a critical tipping-point phase, and he was fully aware of how quickly it could get dangerously close once more.<br><br>Fortunately, many understood this, particularly the ministers and assemblypersons who'd been present during the apocalyptic battle that had consumed this very city. They'd continue to support him as long as his policies were successful. On the other hand, Baalkpan had grown tremendously as labor and troops flooded in from all over the Union, and most of the newcomers had no personal experience with the war besides the hard work they performed to support it. That was the true source of the disconnect. There was a growing desire to get on with the better life promised by the industrial and economic revolution Alan himself had set in motion. Therefore, though he remained highly popular with the people, only the assembly members from Maa-ni-la, Aryaal and B'mbaado, North Borno, Austraal, and Baalkpan itself, of course, were solidly behind him. And of those members, only "King" Tony Scott of the Khonashi in North Borno might be considered a close personal friend, who'd stick through thick and thin. Then again, Tony shared his perspective in a number of ways. Not only had he ridden herd over an even more bizarrely diverse constituency-the Khonashi were a mixed tribe of Grik-like beings and humans, who'd absorbed former enemies into their population-but Tony was also a former shipmate from USS Walker.<br><br>Members from Saa-leebs in general, and Sular in particular, were generally more antagonistic and stood figuratively and literally somewhat apart on the pier that day. Assemblypersons from Sina-pore and B'taava (which barely had enough people to qualify for independent representation, and then only because Sular had sent so many colonists there), stood close to the delegations from Saa-leebs. Others from Yoko-haama and the seagoing Homes, many of which were politically united, tended to follow Maa-ni-la's lead. Many more stood squarely in the middle, and Alan longed for the days when there hadn't been so many factions within the cause. I don't much miss the reason, though, he realized philosophically. We were losing then.<br><br>Still, it was a mess, and growing more fractious as the war dragged on. But Alan had helped create the monster, and figured in the long run, if the Union survived, the diversity that formed it could only make it stronger. In the meantime, it probably seemed awfully confusing to the representatives of their more . . . monarchical allies, also present. These included Ambassador Bolton Forester of the Empire of the New Britain Isles, and formerly Leftenant, now Ambassador, Doocy Meek from the Republic of Real People. Of the two, he counted Bolton a friend. He'd lingered long after he would've preferred being replaced to help maintain the stability of the Alliance. The Empire was a Pacific power and its Governor-Empress wielded near absolute authority, since the cooperative plots by the New Britain Company and the twisted Dominion in Central and South America resulted in the murder of her family and nearly the entire Courts of Directors and Proprietors. Her nation was chiefly focused on prosecuting the war against the Doms, and there were those in the new Union who considered that theater much too far away to concern themselves with. Fortunately, most knew better. The Doms, though human, were just as bad as the Grik and had been, at least until recently, a more technologically dangerous foe.<br><br>Alan didn't know what to think of Doocy Meek. He'd arrived only the day before, after a very long flight from Zanzibar, via Madraas, Andamaan, B'taava, and finally Aryaal, but came highly recommended by Captain Reddy. The Republic, while ostensibly closer to the Union in regard to species diversity and political organization, was really more similar to the Roman Empire, which had undoubtedly, somehow, influenced it at some point. Its aristocratic senators held power over the purse strings of the nation situated on the southern tip of Africa, but its Lemurian kaiser, Nig-Taak, had the final authority. His senate could choose not to fund his policies, but that could be risky, since he and his family were very popular, representing the stability the Republic craved, and there were always other aristocratic families from the various provinces angling for their constituents' approval. Senators were chosen by electors who could be picked by popular vote at any time.<br><br>The population was composed almost equally of Lemurians, humans (from very diverse races and even histories, it seemed), and a third species called Gentaa, which legend mistakenly considered human-Lemurian hybrids because they shared physical attributes of each. Courtney Bradford was adamant that this was a myth and the Gentaa were probably imports from yet another evolutionary past. In any event, the Republic was in the war at last. After a tentative start, its armies had finally lurched into action against the Grik in southern Africa, giving the Allies a long-needed second front for their enemy to worry about.<br><br>Surrounding the already relatively large gathering of officials were thousands of citizens of Baalkpan: sailors, troops, even yard workers who'd momentarily stopped what they were doing to watch from precarious perches atop cranes or other ships at the pier. Everyone was on hand for what had promised to be a triumphant celebration of the completion of the largest, fastest, most powerful modern warship ever built on this world (as far as they knew), but Henry Stokes had discreetly presented Alan with a cryptic report when he arrived that the trials hadn't gone quite as well as hoped. Alan was extremely anxious and had a sinking feeling that the celebration might quickly turn into a morale-pounding flop.<br><br>"What's the matter, dear?" Karen asked, noting Alan's furtive glances at the spectators and various assemblypersons.<br><br>"Oh, nothing." He managed a smile. "You know me and crowds."<br><br>Karen glared at him, sure he was lying, but shrugged.<br><br>"How long now, Daddy?" piped little Allison Verdia in her heartwarming toddler voice, tugging on the sleeve of Alan's dress whites.<br><br>"Yeah," agreed their older Lemurian daughter, Sandra, fidgeting with her skirt while looking at other Lemurian younglings scampering around. They were all naked, but Karen insisted that her children would wear clothes. Sandra, named after Captain Reddy's wife and Karen's friend, was probably about four, but nobody knew for sure. Nor had she known her Lemurian name. Still, Karen figured she'd gained the size and maturity roughly equal to a human child of six or seven, and she spoke perfect English, without the odd pronunciations common among older speakers who learned the language. "I wanna play," Sandra emphasized, watching the younglings shoot up the cranes in marauding packs. They were never allowed in the yard and were taking the rare opportunity to explore it from all angles. "Later, sweetheart," Karen temporized, watching the same younglings with alarm.<br><br>Their younger adopted daughter, Seetsi, had a name when they got her but was still just an infant. She was sleeping in a carriage, pushed by their one-armed nanny, Unaa-Saan-Maar. Unaa was a former Lemurian Marine and had left her own younglings in the care of another nanny-with offspring of her own-at the Great Hall.<br><br>"I think she's coming in now," Alan said, hearing excited cries from the 'Cats with the highest vantage points. Even before the rest of the crowd caught sight of USS Fitzhugh Gray, however, coming through the narrow channel into the bay, the excitement started changing to dismay as word quickly spread, and the air of celebration began to turn.<br><br>"What's the matter?" Karen asked, standing on her toes.<br><br>"I reckon," began Henry Stokes in a very dry tone, "that no one expected to see the bloody thing towed back to port."<br><br>Alan glared at him. "Towed? Why? And why didn't you warn me?"<br><br>Stokes shrugged. "What difference would it've made?"<br><br>"I . . . I might've told them to bring her in after dark," he replied, as the crowd grew more disappointed.<br><br>"An' lose half a day fixin' whatever failed?"<br><br>Alan had no reply.<br><br>"Pick me up, Daddy!" Allison demanded. Without thinking, Alan raised his daughter and plunked her on his shoulders. He could barely see the tops of the tall funnels in the distance now, and the ship's high "fighting top" on her foremast as she was towed past the Baalkpan ATC. He could also see the masts and funnels of the two transports, heavier, beamier versions of Scott-class steam frigates, pulling her in.<br><br>"Daddy," Allison said doubtfully, with her better view, "I think that boat is broken."<br><br>"What's the dope?" Alan asked Stokes. "What's the matter with her?"<br><br>"Why don't we let Commander Miyata tell us himself? He'll be here soon enough an' we'll get the full report." Stokes borrowed a speaking trumpet from a nearby yard foreman and raised it questioningly. Alan reluctantly nodded, and Stokes, a former leading seaman aboard HMAS Perth on another world, scampered halfway up the stout timbers supporting the closest crane and raised the trumpet to his lips. "Attention! Your attention, please!" Most 'Cats, in the yard at least, spoke some English. All the ex-pat Impies did. Others had to wait for a translation. He paused while the hubbub died down. "Thanks," he continued. "Now, it appears the Gray had a bit o' bother with her engineerin' plant, an' Captain Miyata chose to shut it down before it got worse. That's what sea trials are for; to find problems so we can fix 'em. No worries; it's nothin' serious. On the other hand, reports are that all her weapons're fine, an' work better than expected. Her new fire-control systems're the best we've made." He laughed. "She ain't sinkin, an' we'll have 'er fixed up an' sent out to help Captain Reddy in no time! So give her an' her crew a good onya when she comes alongside. But stand ready to clear the dock so we can get right to work on her, yeah?"<br><br>"Karen," Alan said, "Why don't you take the kids home? I might be here a while."<br><br>"Okay. And then I'll head over to the hospital for a while." She frowned. "Let me know what you find out?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>A much smaller crowd did give Gray a nice welcome an hour and a half later when she finally touched the dock, but it was more subdued than it would've been if she'd steamed in under her own power. And, as Henry Stokes asked, the onlookers cleared fairly quickly once Gray's lines were doubled up. Even most of the ministers and all but one assemblyperson had gone, leaving a few deputies, some of whom Alan would've wished away. Specifically underscoring this, as soon as the brow was rigged, the deputy assemblyperson from Sular, an annoying pain in Alan's ass named Giaan-Naak, tried to lead the others up the ramp.<br><br>"Hold it!" Alan snapped, earning a resentful blink. "That's not how we do it in the Navy Clan, or anywhere else I know of," he reminded forcefully. "You will not just stampede aboard!"<br><br>"Thaat's our ship as much as yours!" Giaan objected.<br><br>"That's debatable," Stokes murmured. "Far as I know, all Sular's tax revenue has gone to support Sixth Corps in India-where it ain't doin' a bloody thing-an' sendin' colonists to B'taava."<br><br>"Enough," Alan said, tired of the ongoing argument. "But it doesn't matter who paid for her; she was built for Captain Reddy's clan. My clan," he stressed, "to defend us all. You can go aboard as soon as Commander Miyata's prepared to entertain you. I have official business." He turned. "Mr. Stokes, uh . . . 'King' Scott, and Ambassadors Forester and Meek, will you join me?"<br><br>"You take them?" Giaan seethed. "All foreigners, and none of them even people!" There were gasps, even from some of Giaan's companions, but for the first time Alan realized he was right, in a way. Everyone he'd invited was human. But he was simultaneously stunned and furious because he couldn't remember how long it had been since he even thought like that. "Deputy Assemblyperson Giaan," Alan said icily, "I said you could go aboard soon, but even you must understand that I need the first report." He nodded at Tony. "'King' Scott's not only a head of state but a full assemblyperson. The only one still here. If others had stayed, I'd have invited them as well-but they probably get that there's a lot to do, and I'll give the entire assembly a full and complete report as soon as I have it. As for ambassadors Forester and Meek, they enjoy the same status as heads of state, as the senior representatives of their national leaders in Baalkpan." His expression darkened. "And you'll apologize at once for implying they're not people, or I'll personally and unmercifully pester your boss until you're replaced and sent home. Is that understood?"<br><br>Giaan recoiled amid the shocked chatter around him, and Alan was perversely satisfied to hear the deputy from Maa-ni-la tell another: "Indeed. Well said. They were all people enough for him when Giaan fled to the Filpin Laands with so many other Sularaans, raather than fight when the Grik came as far as Baalkpan!" Giaan must've heard, because he spun and flashed his hate with fluttering eyelids. Turning back once more, however, he seemed to have composed himself. "I . . . aa-pologize if my zealous protection of Sularaan interests has caused offense."<br><br>Alan shook his head. That was no apology at all, but it was the best he was likely to get and he couldn't afford to widen the rift with Sular right now. He'd never understand it. Sularaans in general were fine folks, and many were in the armies and the Navy. But how the hell did the same shitbags who ran out on them when the Grik came get put back in charge when they slithered back? Then it dawned on him. Because most of the ones who stayed were here-or in the armies and the Navy! Sular had been a ghost city until the "runaways" returned. He sighed inwardly. They'll be in for a shock when the war's over-if it ever is-and all those veterans go home and kick their asses out of office. In the meantime, he'd just have to put up with their crap. Without another word, Alan turned and tromped up the bouncing brow. Tony Scott limped behind him, crutch under one arm and his ruined leg in a brace. Forester and Meek followed, leaving only Stokes. For a moment he just smiled at Giaan, w...</p><h2>Folktales of Bhutan</h2><p>The first attempt of a Bhutanese to record in English the oral traditions of their kingdom has resulted in this collection of thirty-eight folktales and legends. 35 pp. illustrations.

During that interview Carnegie slyly dropped a hint of certain master power he used; a magic law of the human mind - a little known psychological principle - which was amazing in its power. Carnegie suggested to Hill that upon that principle he could build the philosophy of all personal success - whether it be measured in terms of Money, Power, Position, Prestige, Influence, Accumulation of Wealth. That part of the interview never went into Hill&#39;s magazine. But it did launch the young author upon over 20 years of research. And today we open to YOU the discovery and methods of using the revolutionary force which Carnegie quietly hinted at. The thrilling methods of using it are now taught in eight textbooks known as the LAW OF SUCCESS. In the trail of the LAW OF SUCCESS lessons come accomplishments, not mere entertainment and time-killing diversion. There come larger businesses, bigger bank accounts, fatter pay envelopes; small enterprises given new life and power to grow; low-pay employees shown how to gain advancement by leaps and bounds. Think and Grow Rich is Napoleon Hill&#39;s newest book, based upon his famous LAW OF SUCCESS philosophy. His work and writings have been praised by great leaders in finance, education, politics, and government.</p><p>This original version of THINK AND GROW RICH from our publishing boutique, Black Swan Publishing, Atlanta Georgia is the best version to capture the full message and philosophy of this timeless book.

Crisscrossing the continent, Flannery shows us how the destiny of this extraordinary creature is inseparable from the environment that created it. Along the way he uses encounters with ancient aboriginal cultures and eccentric fossil hunters, farmers and scientists, kangaroo advocates and kangaroo hunters, to explore how Australia&#x2019;s deserts and rainforests have shaped human responses to the continent -- and how kangaroos have evolved to handle the resulting challenges. Ultimately, <i>Chasing Kangaroos</i> is a smart yet utterly readable synthesis of memoir, travel, natural history, and evolutionary science -- and further proof of Flannery&#x2019;s offhand interdisciplinary brilliance&#x201d; (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>).</p><p>This paean to a remarkable animal by Flannery, author of the well-received global warming treatise <i>The Weather Makers</i>, is fascinating but scattershot. The kangaroo, the only large animal that hops, can travel at speeds of 15&#x2013;40 kilometers per hour. Female kangaroos, who carry their young in pouches, have two vaginas, but don't give birth through either of them, and are always pregnant, because they mate a few hours after their young are born. There are 70-odd species of kangaroo: some drink salt water; others live in trees. But as a paleontologist, Flannery is obsessed with finding out when and where the first kangaroos lived. Much of the book is about his searches for the fossils of extinct species in remote areas of the Australian outback, where he discovered the remains of "the grandfather of all kangaroos," as well as the fossils of ice age giants, such as the short-faced kangaroo and a carnivorous kangaroo. The accounts of his discoveries are engaging, but he covers too much ground, switching back and forth between physical descriptions, kangaroo evolution, reminiscences of his fossil hunting travels, worries about Australia's environment and the aborigines, and his controversial extinction theories.

All rights reserved.Those who've had trouble sleeping since reading Flannery's book about global warming (<i>The Weather Makers,</i> 2006) may be surprised to learn that his true passion is not doomsday scenarios--it's kangaroos. Although these fascinating animals are practically synonymous with Australia, as a budding paleontologist, Flannery was shocked at the gaps in scientific knowledge about them, and he has been trying to fill those gaps ever since. Written with both earthy humor and scientific precision, this book is almost as unique its subject. It's part memoir and travelogue (it begins with his youthful attempt to circumnavigate Australia by motorcycle), part natural history (it's loaded with information about the changes wrought by nature and man), and part scientific clue hunt (his attempts to solve the puzzle of the 'roo's origins are hampered by gaps in the geological record). Readers who start out thinking that Flannery's mania for marsupials is a bit nerdy will soon envy his passion so much that they'll feel like they're the real nerds themselves. This delightful journey of discovery will appeal to fans of Bill Bryson and Mark Kurlansky. <i>Keir Graff</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The elements of the Southwest scorned by an urban-industrial nation&#x2014;awesome vistas, intense light, and isolation&#x2014;drew such notables as D. H. Lawrence and Georgia O'Keefe.<br><br>These aesthetes succeeded where speculators had failed&#x2014;they made the Southwest attractive to the outside world. Their lives and works contradicted the conventional image of the Southwest as a cultural desert. They became citizens of their communities and precipitated a renaissance in Indian and Hispanic art. When federal policy forbade indigenous lifestyles, religion, and art in an attempt to Anglicize the Indians, the artists and writers of northern New Mexico not only challenged these policies but began to incorporate "primitive" elements into their own works and to encourage Indian artists.<br><br>This is the story of the golden age of Santa Fe and Taos, from 1900 to 1942&#x2014;the Age of the Muses. It is the story of Mary Austin, known as "God's mother�in-law," and of Mabel Dodge Luhan, Taos "salon-keeper" who helped shape the colonies. And it is the story of the many artists&#x2014;painters, writers, sculptors, architects, and musicians&#x2014;that helped create the artistic aura that exists in northern New Mexico today.</p><p><p><b>Arrell Morgan Gibson</b> (1921&#x2013;1987) was the George Lynn Cross Research Professor of History at the University of Oklahoma.

[He] takes us on a lively tour of engineers, their creations and their necessary turns of mind."&nbsp;&nbsp; --Los Angeles Times<br><br>From the Ferris wheel to the integrated circuit, feats of engineering have changed our environment in countless ways, big and small. In Remaking the World: Adventures in Engineering, Duke University's Henry Petroski focuses on the big: Malaysia's 1,482-foot Petronas Towers as well as the Panama Canal, a cut through the continental divide that required the excavation of 311 million cubic yards of earth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remaking the World tells the stories behind the man-made wonders of the world, from squabbles over the naming of the Hoover Dam to the effects the Titanic disaster had on the engineering community of 1912. Here, too, are the stories of the <br>personalities behind the wonders, from the jaunty Isambard Kingdom Brunel, designer of nineteenth-century transatlantic steamships, to Charles Steinmetz, oddball genius of the General Electric Company, whose office of preference was a battered twelve-foot canoe. Spirited and absorbing, Remaking the World is a celebration of the creative instinct and of the men and women whose inspirations have immeasurably improved our world.<br><br>"Petroski [is] America's poet laureate of technology. . . . Remaking the World is another fine book."&nbsp;&nbsp; --Houston Chronicle<br><br>"Remaking the World really is an adventure in engineering."<br>--San Diego Union-Tribune</p><p>Engineers, Henry Petroski observes, are sometimes their own worst enemies, at least so far as communicating their work to the general public is concerned. Some engineers, of course, have been exceptions. One of the unlikely heroes of Petroski's <i>Remaking the World</i>, an entertaining foray into some of engineering's finest (and, on occasion, less exalted) moments, is Karl August Rudolf Steinmetz, who combined a great talent for design and engineering with a keenly practiced flair for self-promotion. Another is Washington Gale Ferris, the inventor of the Ferris wheel, who concocted several dangerous eyesores before arriving at the design familiar to amusement-park patrons.<p> Successful at explaining themselves or not, engineers are largely responsible for the world as we know it, and Petroski examines their work to discuss how good design and technology combine to produce the desired results. That combination involves much trial and error, and, as Petroski writes, "artifacts from paper clips to steamships evolve by removing some real or perceived failure of their ancestors to achieve unqualified success." Drawing on examples from past and present, Petroski offers an up-close view of how engineers do their work, and his history is full of surprises and pleasures. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Henry Petroski is the Aleksandar S. Vesic Professor of Civil Engineering and Professor of History at Duke University, where he also serves as chairman of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The author of seven previous books, he has received grants from the National Science Foundation and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Humanities Center.</p><h2>The Magic of Remedios Varo</h2><p>This volume published on the occasion of the first major exhibition of Varo&#39;s art in the United States hosted by the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, DC., studies the full range of Varo&#39;s work. It considers her formal artistic training in the rigid academic atmosphere of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, and her sojourns in Paris in 1930 and 1937, which brought Varo into contact with the surrealist movement of Andr� Breton that was to define her artistic expression for the rest of her career. The main part of the book is devoted to the period following her exile in Mexico in 1940. It was here that Varo&#39;s art became fully defined, and where she was recognized and championed by leading intellectual figures, such as the poet Octavio Paz. This volume celebrates in 77 beautiful colour paintings the complexity of Varo&#39;s art, which defies easy classification.</p><p></p><h2>Marvel Adventures The Avengers Vol. 1: Heroes Assembled</h2><p>When global threats surface, they have to contend with the combined might of: Captain America, Storm, Iron Man, The Hulk, Giant-Girl, Wolverine and Spider-Man!

Reprint.</p><p>Setting: Miramonte, California--present day.<p> Sensuality Rating: 6</p><p> Following the success of her previous novels (<i>Garden of Lies</i> and <i>Thorns of Truth</i>), bestselling author Eileen Goudge's <i>One Last Dance</i> introduces readers to four women, Lydia Seagrave and her three daughters. Daphne, a successful novelist, is married to a doctor and mother of two children; Kitty, proprietor of a bakery in their hometown of Miramonte, California, hungers to have a baby; and Alex, the youngest, a divorced realtor, struggles to make ends meet while raising twins. On the eve of her 40th wedding anniversary, Lydia, who loves her husband enormously, picks up a gun and kills him. Straining to make sense of the tragedy, the sisters must face the lies hidden behind their image as an idyllic family. In the process, they must confront deceptions at the heart of each of their lives. Eileen Goudge paints a portrait of four women striving to build real and honest lives by challenging a sometimes-painful reality. <i>--Alison Trinkle</i></p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

Each lazy wave licks my feet, then retreats as if beckoning me into the Atlantic Ocean, whispering of adventure. Of mischief. <br>Of peace-and-freaking quiet. <br>Which is all I want after this past summer. What with Jagen&#x2019;s attempt to take over the kingdoms, our near discovery by humans, me leading a wall of fish to an underwater tribunal&#x2014;we barely had room to breathe. And then our breath was all but stolen away from us when Rachel drowned. <br>We deserve a break from it all, Galen and I. But it doesn&#x2019;t look like we&#x2019;re getting one. <br>Behind me, the wind hauls with it the occasional shout erupting from my house. The bellows of Galen and his older brother Grom taint the air with a rancor that repels me farther from the house and deeper into the water. I roll up my pajama pants and, letting the saltwater have its way with my calves, try to ignore the words I can make out between the squawks of seagulls overhead. <br>Words like &#x201c;loyalty&#x201d; and &#x201c;privacy&#x201d; and &#x201c;law.&#x201d; I cringe when I hear the word &#x201c;grief.&#x201d; That word comes from Grom, and after it, no words come from Galen. It&#x2019;s a kind of silence I&#x2019;ve come to recognize from him. One filled with anguish, torment, guilt, and the overwhelming need to say or do something to hide it. <br>But there is no hiding that Rachel&#x2019;s death mauled the deepest parts of him. She was more than just his assistant. She was his closest human friend. Maybe the others don&#x2019;t see the depths of it. If they did, they wouldn&#x2019;t throw it in his face or use it against him. But I do see it. I know what it&#x2019;s like to have so much heartache you come to despise the air that keeps you alive. <br>Galen doesn&#x2019;t cry. He doesn&#x2019;t talk about her. There seems to be a part of Galen that belonged to Rachel, and she took that part with her. What&#x2019;s left of him is trying hard to function without the missing piece, but it can&#x2019;t quite coordinate. Like a car running on empty. <br>I want to help him, to tell him I know how he feels. But comforting someone is different than being comforted. In a way, it&#x2019;s harder. I went through this after Dad died of cancer. After my best friend Chloe was attacked by a shark. But I still don&#x2019;t know what to do or say to make it better for Galen. Because only many, many sunrises can soften the pain. And it hasn&#x2019;t been long enough for that yet. <br>I feel bad that I left my mom in the kitchen to deal with this mess by herself. Poseidon princess that she is, this is a difficult problem to navigate alone. But I can&#x2019;t go back in yet. Not until I think of a fantastic excuse for why I thought it was okay to abandon a very serious and very-important-to-Galen conversation. I should be there with them in the kitchen, standing beside him, arms crossed, giving Grom the stank eye to reiterate that I am not his Royal subject and that I&#x2019;m on Galen&#x2019;s side no matter what that might involve. <br>But it&#x2019;s hard to face Grom like that when I&#x2019;m kinda sorta in agreement with him. Especially since the Triton king is one of the most intimidating people I&#x2019;ve ever had the misfortune to meet. He would hone in on my reluctance. He would see through me if I put up pretenses about the trip. <br>This stupid trip. <br>Last year at prom&#x2014;well, our own version of prom, which involved dancing underwater in Armani&#x2014;we promised each other we would take a trip to the mountains. To get away from it all, or whatever. And at first, this whole summer jaunt inland with Galen seemed like a good idea to me. Actually, it seemed like unfiltered heaven. He&#x2019;s adamant that he wants to be alone with me. To make up for all the time we lost mutually denying our feelings for each other. Then the time we spent fending off Jagen&#x2019;s advance on both the kingdoms. And what could be better than that? Spending private time with Galen is about a ten on my Ecstasy-O-Meter. <i>Of course</i> I want to steal back all of the lost time&#x2014;I&#x2019;d steal the time <i>before</i> we actually met if I could somehow bribe the universe to grant wishes. <br>But the bigger reason&#x2014;the real reason&#x2014;I think Galen wants to get away is Rachel. I know he wants a change in scenery. He wants to get away from the house they shared together. Especially from the now maddeningly quiet kitchen where she used to click around in stilettos while preparing him delectable seafood dishes. The house used to smell of cooking food and swirling Italian perfume and possibly gunpowder if you came on the right day. <br>And don&#x2019;t I know how that feels? Waking up every day in my bedroom full of all things Chloe was like getting a daily, fast-acting injection of painful memories. Staring at my dad&#x2019;s empty place setting at the table felt like watching vultures of the past circling around his empty chair. But Galen hasn&#x2019;t allowed himself to start the grieving process. And this trip seems to be an attempt to keep it at bay even longer. Which can&#x2019;t be healthy. And since it&#x2019;s not healthy, I feel more like an enabler than a supporter. <br>Either way, I should go back now. I should go back and be there for Galen and tell Grom that no matter his reasons Galen needs this trip. Then express my own concerns with Galen privately. I should be there for him now and support him in front of the others, just as he would for me&#x2014;just as he&#x2019;s already done for me. <br>I&#x2019;ll need to explain myself&#x2014;why I left during the conversation in the first place&#x2014;say something so that I don&#x2019;t look like the jerk that I am. Tact hasn&#x2019;t been my specialty lately. I&#x2019;m thinking Galen&#x2019;s sister Rayna is contagious, and she&#x2019;s somehow infected me with her rudeness. But maybe tact isn&#x2019;t what I need. Maybe I should try her truth. <i>The truth would only embarrass Galen</i>, I decide. And make him feel even more alone. <br>Or maybe I&#x2019;m just being a quivering chicken about the whole thing. <br>I guess I have to take an honest-to-God stab at tact. Lovely. <br>As soon as I turn to go back, I sense my grandfather in the water. The pulse of the Poseidon King Antonis coils around my legs like a tightening string. Fan-freaking-tastic. Just what we need. Another Royal opinion on the matter of our road trip. <br>I wait for him to surface, trying to think of a great excuse as to why he shouldn&#x2019;t go to the house. I&#x2019;ve got nothing. Anything I say will come off as unwelcoming, when really, I&#x2019;d like to see him more often. He&#x2019;s high up on the list of people&#x2014;well, people who have a fin&#x2014;I&#x2019;d like to spend time with. But now is not a good time for spending. <br>It&#x2019;s not long before my excuse to shoo him away presents itself in the form of Naked Grandfather. I cover my eyes, irritation bubbling up against my will. &#x201c;Really? You really forget every single time you change into human form to put shorts on? You cannot go in the house like that.&#x201d; <br>Grandfather sighs. &#x201c;My apologies, young Emma. But you must admit, all these human traditions are a bit overwhelming. Where might I find a short?&#x201d; <br>That clothes seem like a mountainous burden to him reminds me that our worlds are spectacularly different. And that I could learn a lot from him. Without unshielding my eyes, I point toward the water, in the exact opposite direction I know Galen has a pair hidden. When in doubt, stall. &#x201c;Try over there. Under the slab of rock. And they&#x2019;re called <i>shorts,</i> not &#x2018;a short.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;ll have to bore someone else with your human expressions, young one. I couldn&#x2019;t possibly care less.&#x201d; I hear him disappear under the water, surfacing several seconds later. &#x201c;The short is not here.&#x201d; <br>I shrug. &#x201c;Guess you can&#x2019;t go in then.&#x201d; This is going better than I thought it would. <br>I can practically feel him crossing his arms at me. Here we go. <br>&#x201c;You think I&#x2019;m here to object to your going inland with Galen.&#x201d; <br>My mouth drops open. And I stutter excessively when I say, &#x201c;Well. Um. Aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Because so far, he&#x2019;s done nothing but play hall monitor between me and Galen. A few months ago, he walked in on us while we were making out, and Galen nearly passed out because of it. Ever since then Galen has been terrified of disappointing the Poseidon king, so Grandfather&#x2019;s negative opinion on this trip might actually be a game changer. <br>Which is why he cannot go in the house. <br>I hear Grandfather melt into the water, and he confirms it with, &#x201c;You can turn around now.&#x201d; Only his shoulders and chest are above the waves. He smiles. It&#x2019;s the kind of adoring smile I&#x2019;ve always imagined a grandfather gives his grandchildren when they bring him their most hideous Crayola creation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m certainly not happy about you going inland, of course. I had wanted to spend a bit more time together, too. But I know from past experience that Poseidon princesses are not inclined to care about my opinion.&#x201d; <br>It&#x2019;s kind of cool to be referred to as a princess, even though my mother is <i>the</i> princess of Poseidon territory. Still, I raise a get-to-the-point brow. Grandfather responds best to frank and direct. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to speak to you, Emma. Only you.&#x201d; <br>Mortified, I wonder if there exists a Syrena expression for &#x201c;the birds and the bees talk.&#x201d; Probably there is, and it&#x2019;s probably some god-awful analogy having to do with plankton or worse. <br>In the distance, we hear a shout of outrage. He cocks his head at me. &#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you in there helping your prince?&#x201d; <br> <i>If I thought I felt guilty before</i>&nbsp;&#x2026; But then I remember that this business is not for Grandfather&#x2019;s nose. I&#x2019;m actually doing Galen a favor by stalling now. &#x201c;Because if I stay there any longer, I&#x2019;ll grow a beard from all the testosterone hovering in the air.&#x201d; Of course, my answer is over his head; he indicates this with a bored-silly eye roll. Syrena do not know&#x2014;nor apparently care&#x2014;what testosterone is. <br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t wish to tell me, that is fine,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I have trust in your judgment.&#x201d; More shouting from behind me. Maybe my judgment sucks after all. I&#x2019;m about to excuse myself, when he says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s better this way, that they&#x2019;re distracted. What I have to say is for your ears only, young Emma.&#x201d; A seagull overhead drops a bomb then, and it lands cleanly on Grandfather&#x2019;s shoulder. He mutters some fishy expletive and swishes saltwater over the offending white glob, setting it off to sea. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you come into the water, so we can close some of the distance between us? I&#x2019;d rather someone didn&#x2019;t overhear. Here, I&#x2019;ll change back to Syrena form if that will make you more comfortable.&#x201d; <br>I wade into the Atlantic, not caring to roll up my pajamas this time. I pass a large crab who looks like he&#x2019;s tempted to nip at me. I squat in the water, submerging my entire head, and come face-to-face with the crab. &#x201c;If you pinch me,&#x201d; I tell it, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick you up and throw you on the beach for the gulls.&#x201d; The Gift of Poseidon&#x2014;the ability to talk to fish&#x2014;does have its advantages. Bossing around marine life is just one of them. <br>I&#x2019;ve come to realize crabs in particular throw mini temper tantrums. I wonder if that&#x2019;s where the term &#x201c;crabby&#x201d; came from in the first place. He scuttles away, as if I&#x2019;ve ruined his whole day. When I resurface and reach Grandfather, I can no longer touch the ground. Gliding up to him, I say, &#x201c;So? We&#x2019;re as private as we can be.&#x201d; <br>Then he smiles at me like I am the reason he is floating instead of the waves or his powerful fin. &#x201c;Before you leave on your adventure, young Emma, I need to tell you about a town called Neptune.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>COPYRIGHT � 2014 BY ANNA BANKS</p><h2>The Big Cloud: Specatular Photographs of Storm Clouds</h2><p><b>Witness the power of nature. </b><br><br><b>More than 85 thrilling photographs:</b> These beautiful photographs of stormfronts, tornados, lightning storms, and pitch-black skies engulf the viewer's imagination and never fail to impart the awe-inspiring power of our constantly shifting weather and climate.

It's easy to imagine you are the one alone on the roads in June in Minnesota and across the Plains states, supercells swirling, contorting and swallowing the sky, a witness to nature's force. Seaman puts the reader squarely in her shoes. Some photos bear no description other than a timestamp of their month, year and state. With others, Seaman is spare with her words, describing the storm's structure or impact. Still, words never get in the way, allowing her photos to gather power, page to page."<br> - Minneapolis Star Tribune<br>"The brooding skyscapes, rendered in grays, blacks, and dark browns, capture moments of immense natural turmoil--a huge wedge tornado, crackling laceworks of lightning, opaque supercell clouds that resemble giants' feet bestriding the plains. The images impart a sense of profound human frailty in the face of nature's fury."<br> - Natural History Magazine<br><br>"The Big Cloud" pulls back from the storms, effectively displaying the gigantic physics at work in the churning atmosphere; some of the best photos show the towering skies with tiny, seemingly insignificant homes far of in the distance.

Coastal California north of San Francisco had been home to the Pomo and Yuki people for thousands of years. In the early 1800s, that area was visited by Russian, English, and French fur trappers. In 1850, an opium trader carrying goods from the Orient to gold-rush San Francisco shipwrecked near Fort Bragg. Would-be salvagers discovered giant redwood trees, and lumber mills soon sprang up at the mouth of every stream. &#x201c;Dog-hole schooners&#x201d; transported lumber, passengers, and supplies, and the world-wide Dollar Shipping Lines started here. Former reservation lands were acquired by lumber interests, and the city of Fort Bragg sprang up around them, all while photographers, artists, and writers documented the &#x201c;far West.&#x201d; Today, the former California Western logging railroad transports tourists through the redwood forests. Hollywood movies continue to be set in the New England&#x2013;style towns along the rocky Mendocino Coast, and Paul Bunyan Days celebrates old-time logging skills. The area&#x2019;s colorful past permeates and enriches local culture.</p><p>Most images in this book were selected from the Fort Bragg&#x2013;Mendocino Coast Historical Society&#x2019;s extensive archives.

Vividly evoking the immigrants' everyday experiences through first-person accounts and detailed description, McKibben demonstrates that the cannery work done by Sicilian immigrant women was crucial in terms of the identity formation and community development. These changes allowed their families to survive the challenges of political conflicts over citizenship in World War II and intermarriage with outsiders throughout the migration experience. The women formed voluntary associations and celebrated festas that effectively linked them with each other and with their home villages in Sicily. Continuous migration created a strong sense of transnationalism among Sicilians in Monterey, which has enabled them to continue as a viable ethnic community today.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p><b>Carol Lynn McKibben</b> is a public historian and independent scholar in Monterey, California.

She took enormous interest in all his excavations, and when friends asked what her strange life was like, she decided to answer their questions in this delightful book. First published in 1946, Come, Tell Me How You Live is now reissued in B format. It gives a charming picture of Agatha Christie herself, and is, as Jacquetta Hawkes concludes in her Introduction, &#39;a pure pleasure to read&#39;.</p><p>Agatha Christie was already a celebrated writer of mysteries when, in 1930, she married the archaeologist Max Mallowan. In the pre&#x2013;war years thereafter, Christie enthusiastically joined her husband on various archaeological expeditions in the Middle East, and these shared adventures, these happy and memorable times, provided her not only with the background for several of her novels, but also with the &#x201c;everyday doings and happenings&#x201d; which she zestfully describes in the pages of this high&#x2013;spirited memoir, which was first published in 1946. New Introduction by David Pryce-Jones.<p>To the world she was Agatha Christie, author of numerous bestselling mysteries and whodunits, arguably the most popular writer in the English language. But in the 1930s she wore a different hat, traveling with her husband, renowned archaeologist Max Mallowan, as he investigated the buried ruins and ancient wonders of Syria and Iraq. Described by the author as a "meandering chronicle of life on an archaeological dig," <em>Come, Tell Me How You Live</em> is Dame Agatha Christie's first-person account of her time spent in this breathtaking corner of the globe where recorded human history began. It is a fascinating, eye-opening, vibrant, and vivid portrait of a place, a people, and a past, by a legendary writer whose extraordinary popularity endures to this day; an altogether remarkable narrative of everyday life in a world now long since vanished.</p></p><h2>Women, Hormones and the Menstrual Cycle</h2><p>Ruth Trickey, with practitioners from the Melbourne Holistic Health Group, provide comprehensive treatment protocols based on years of research and clinical experience.

His Story</h2><p>In the name of &#x201c;That Man!&#x201d; people who claimed to be his followers carried out endless persecutions, proclaiming the absolute rejection and eternal damnation of the Jewish people, his people. They lied, but their vile actions and teachings had an impact which continues to this day. For centuries, it was forbidden to even utter the name of &#x201c;That Man!&#x201d; in the Jewish community. His name remained unspoken or distorted. He was only referred to in oblique ways. But the story of &#x201c;That Man!&#x201d; is a first-century Jewish story of God's faithfulness to Israel. It is presented as completely dependent upon and flowing from Tanakh &#x2014; the Law (Torah), the Prophets (Nevi&#x2019;im), and the Writings (Ketuvim) &#x2014; the authorized, accepted revelation from the God of Israel. All subsequent revelations are to be judged by it. In Tanakh, God laid out His purposes for humanity, for Israel, and for &#x201c;Messiah&#x201d;. This story presents Yeshua, &#x201c;That Man!&#x201d; as the prophesied Messiah of Israel. It combines the four different accounts into one. It provides an opportunity for those who want to know his true story, free from the historical distortions. The decision to reject or accept his claims can then be an informed one. The extant manuscripts were written in a Jewish Greek that had its own peculiarities, designed to reflect concepts and definitions which could only be found, in their wholeness, in the Hebrew Biblical world. The writings of Josephus, Philo, and the earlier Septuagint (LXX) translation of Tanakh also employed this Jewish Greek. They therefore are useful as a bridge to the original Hebrew content and context from which the story is drawn. The text used in &#x201c;That Man!&#x201d; &#x2014; His Story &#x2014; both verses and notes &#x2014; is taken from The Messianic Writings, an annotated translation. A more complete introduction and explanation, as well as more extensive notes, can be found in The Messianic Writings. The notes from the Talmud (&#x201c;Tal. ..."), Midrash (&#x201c;Mid. ..."), and traditional liturgy, et al. are by no means either comprehensive or systematic. Nor do they indicate approval or disapproval, but rather are an attempt to help illustrate the context. It should not, however, be assumed that the Rabbinic material is contemporary with the time of the Story. Usually it is later. Where quotations from Tanakh appear in the Messianic Writings, or where particular passages from Tanakh are relevant, they are cited in [brackets] following the phrase or sentence. In the common Jewish usage of the times, such quotations were given either to indicate the fulfillment of a specific prophecy, or to apply it in a particular way. Occasionally, references from the Apocrypha (&#x201c;Apoc. ...") or other contemporary Jewish writings are also cited. Though these writings are not part of the Biblical text, they were well known in the first century, and were sometimes used by the Biblical writers for illustration or example. In the citations, since verse numbering sometimes varies from language to language, &#x201c;1:1H&#x201d; refers to the Hebrew text, &#x201c;1:1LXX&#x201d; to the Septuagint. Hebrew, Greek, and many other languages distinguish between the singular and plural second person pronoun. Sometimes the correct understanding of a verse depends upon this distinction. In this story, a plus sign (+) is used to signify the plural &#x2014; &#x201c;you+&#x201d; and &#x201c;your+&#x201d;. Following the text of this Story, there are a few longer, explanatory notes on selected, problematic issues.

They have been writing and publishing fiction for at least a decade.<br><br>Aim�e and David Thurlo live in Corrales, New Mexico, with a varied and ever-changing menagerie.<br><p>CHAPTER ONE<br>Special Investigator Ella Clah glanced at the dark clouds that loomed over Beautiful Mountain as she drove down the highway. The sacred peak rose toward that brooding sky as if imploring rain from Water Sprinkler, the rain bringer of the gods. The old ones of her tribe said that the mountains were living beings and, in a way, she agreed with them. The four sacred mountains that bordered their land inspired a sense of history and permanency that was hard to explain, and impossible to deny. They were a part of her and The Dineh.<br><br>The smell of dry air and dust filled her nostrils. It was a parched, skin-drying sensation that spoke volumes to anyone who&#x2019;d been raised on the reservation. Unless the summer rains came early this year, sheep would be hard pressed to find forage, and crops would wither out in the fields.<br><br>Thunder echoed in the distance, resonating off the metal skin of her Jeep like the roll of a kettle drum. Despite the light show on the horizon, if today turned out like yesterday and the day before, there wouldn&#x2019;t be any rain. The clouds would dissipate over the mountains, and the sun would break through just before dusk to warm the evening.<br><br>Ella shifted in her seat, tugging at the seat belt and wondering why she couldn&#x2019;t shake that vague sense of uneasiness that was nagging at her. It was more than the possible 10-27, the homicide, she was on her way to investigate. Trouble was brewing on the reservation, as evidenced by an increasing level of bad news and violence creeping across the area. It wasn&#x2019;t just due to the sudden burst of warm weather after a long, dry winter either. It was much more than that. She could feel it as clearly as the blast of dry air blowing across her face through the gap in the window.<br><br>Some said that she had supernatural powers, a legacy handed down through her family. But that was only because they didn&#x2019;t understand how a cop developed special instincts, or how well-honed her training had made her subconscious observations. At times, such things could spell the difference between life and death but, at the moment, they tugged at her mental shirttail like a child trying to get a mother&#x2019;s attention.<br><br>Hearing the wind howling through the window, she gripped the wheel with one hand and cranked the glass down an inch more, easing the shriek to a dull roar. It was too cool right now for the air conditioner, but, inside the Jeep with the windows closed, it got stuffy and uncomfortable in a hurry, despite the open vents.<br><br>Miserable day, miserable mood, and now, on top of everything else, her skin was crawling. That was a feeling she&#x2019;d learned not to ignore.<br><br>In deference to her FBI training, which had taught her to block out distractions and focus on the task at hand, Ella forced her thoughts back to the crime scene she was enroute to. From the initial report, she&#x2019;d learned a Navajo man had been found beaten to death. The patrol officer sent to the area would secure the site until she and the crime scene team arrived. On the Rez that task wouldn&#x2019;t be much of a problem. Usually little effort was needed here to keep civilians from satisfying their morbid curiosity. Fear of the chindi, the evil in a man that stayed earthbound after death and caused problems for the living, was still strong here.<br><br>Distracted again by a sense of unease, Ella swept the area ahead with eagle-sharp eyes. All of her senses warned of danger drawing closer with each mile. She stared at the ragged cliffs that jutted up from the desert floor like enormous stone gods with their backs to a wall. The view looked the same as always, but something about Four Corners felt different today. Ella&#x2019;s hand went to the badger fetish that hung from a leather thong around her neck. Her brother had given it to her for protection and it comforted her now.<br><br>Ella&#x2019;s radio broke her musings with its crackle. Picking up the mike, she identified herself.<br><br>&#x201c;SI unit One, proceed along highway sixty-four west of Hogback to investigate a reported 10-47 creating a traffic hazard,&#x201c; the dispatcher ordered. &#x201c;We have no other units in the area free to respond.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Negative, PD. I&#x2019;m enroute to a &#x2018;27 south of Morgan Lake.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t have time to investigate a drunken driver complaint now. If by some miracle it did rain today, all the physical evidence would have to be gathered before moisture destroyed the integrity of the scene.<br><br>&#x201c;Channel 6,&#x201c; came another voice, only a few seconds after she&#x2019;d racked the mike.<br><br>Ella recognized the voice of Big Ed Atcitty, the police chief. She switched to the new frequency and picked up the mike again, guessing what he would say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m enroute to the 10-27, Big Ed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Take the 10-47, Shorty,&#x201c; the chief ordered, using the special nickname he&#x2019;d given her, though Ella stood a head taller than he.<br><br>&#x201c;But--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The victim will still be dead if you arrive ten minutes later. Get that driver off my highway first.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;10-4.&#x201d;<br><br>She replaced the mike, grumbling. They needed more cops on the Rez, but that wouldn&#x2019;t happen as long as the current budget crisis prevailed, especially with federal funds drying up and the tribe relying on its own resources. Passing the Morgan Lake turnoff, she continued west, away from the murder scene.<br>Ella was surprised when, instead of dissipating, her uneasiness increased though she was moving away from the crime scene. She tried to ignore the sensation, but the certainty that she was about to start down a dangerous path made her heart race.<br><br>Less than ten minutes later, as she drove toward Shiprock, she spotted a slow moving vehicle ahead. The cherry red sedan, in mint condition, would have been enough to get her attention even if it hadn&#x2019;t been veering all over the road. Pickups and inexpensive sedans were common on the Rez, but not too many local folks drove flashy cars. Money was just too tight, and the roads were lousy.<br><br>Ella took note of the prestige plate that read &#x2018;Angi&#x2019; then flashed the portable lights she&#x2019;d affixed to the dashboard of her unmarked Jeep. The drunk driver in the car didn&#x2019;t slow down, or show any sign that she was even aware of the signal. Ella tried the siren, but the driver seemed oblivious to that as well.<br><br>Moving over as if to pass, Ella pulled up in the left lane beside the red car to ID the driver and signal her to pull over. As she did, Ella saw that the woman shaking, as if in the throes of a convulsion.<br><br>Ella quickly checked to see if the road was still clear ahead, then looking back at the driver, sighed with relief when she saw that the seizure, or whatever it was, had passed.<br><br>She kept her eyes on the young woman a moment longer, trying to assess the situation. Then abruptly `Angi&#x2019; turned her head, and looked directly at Ella. The girl&#x2019;s eyes were blank, glazed over as if she were stoned. There was no recognition, no sense of awareness.<br><br>Ella felt her skin grow cold. She took her foot off the accelerator, and fell back behind the red car, weighing her options. Should she pull ahead to warn oncoming traffic, or try to force the dangerous vehicle off the road? The narrow roadbed and sandy arroyos would make the latter option risky, not to mention the regularly spaced dump truck loads of gravel left by the highway department crews upgrading the road.<br><br>Ella noted the long, wide curve of the asphalt ahead. After they made it around the corner, if the road was clear, she could pick a spot to force the driver off the side. Until then, she had to make sure the driver wouldn&#x2019;t have a head-on with another vehicle.<br><br>She accelerated past the red sedan, sirens and flashers on again in case anyone was coming. As she completed the move, she checked the driver in her rear view mirror. The red sedan had failed to negotiate the turn. All Ella could see was a cloud of dust where the vehicle had left the road.<br><br>Ella worked the brakes and turned the wheel hard, putting the Jeep into a controlled one eighty with a screech. As she sped back, she called the accident in. Seconds later, she pulled to a stop by the side of the road, grabbed her hand held radio, and looked down the slope. The red car had left the highway, nosed over into the shallow wash, then slid sideways and rolled down a steep embankment. It had come to a stop upside down with the driver&#x2019;s compartment half buried in a mountain of gravel. The driver&#x2019;s compartment was half buried in the gravel. It was impossible to tell anything about the condition of the woman inside.<br><br>As she slid down the incline on the seat of her pants, the notion that someone was watching her became a certainty in her mind. She tried to brush aside her uneasiness by telling herself that if someone was there, she hoped they would show themselves and help. She could use an extra pair of hands to dig out the driver.<br><br>Her forced optimism did little to ease the pitch and roll of her stomach. Her muscles were taut, and her hearing almost painfully sharp as she listened for sounds that didn&#x2019;t belong.<br><br>Focusing on the task that required her immediate attention, she began to scoop away the gravel by hand, trying to uncover the driver&#x2019;s door. She could hear the car radio playing an impassioned ad for a local auto dealership, and used that to guide her to the driver. As the smell of gasoline filled her nostrils, she slowed down. She had to avoid creating a spark. Gasoline was leaking through the gravel into the ground, staining the dry earth a reddish brown, like dried blood.<br><br>&#x201c;Hang on. I&#x2019;m going to get you out!&#x201d; Ella yelled, hoping the driver was still conscious and able to understand her. The more she thought about it, though, the less likely that seemed.

According to Patrick Geary, this is historical nonsense. The idea that national character is fixed for all time in a simpler, distant past is groundless, he argues in this unflinching reconsideration of European nationhood. Few of the peoples that many Europeans honor as sharing their sense of ''nation'' had comparably homogeneous identities; even the Huns, he points out, were firmly united only under Attila's ten-year reign.</p><p>Geary dismantles the nationalist myths about how the nations of Europe were born. Through rigorous analysis set in lucid prose, he contrasts the myths with the actual history of Europe's transformation between the fourth and ninth centuries--the period of grand migrations that nationalists hold dear. The nationalist sentiments today increasingly taken for granted in Europe emerged, he argues, only in the nineteenth century. Ironically, this phenomenon was kept alive not just by responsive populations--but by complicit scholars.</p><p>Ultimately, Geary concludes, the actual formation of European peoples must be seen as an extended process that began in antiquity and continues in the present. The resulting image is a challenge to those who anchor contemporary antagonisms in ancient myths--to those who claim that immigration and tolerance toward minorities despoil ''nationhood.''

DuBois</p><p>William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868-1963) is the greatest of African American intellectuals--a sociologist, historian, novelist, and activist whose astounding career spanned the nation's history from Reconstruction to the civil rights movement. Born in Massachusetts and educated at Fisk, Harvard, and the University of Berlin, Du Bois penned his epochal masterpiece, <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, in 1903. It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.<p> With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual "sorrow songs" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in "On Booker T. Washington and Others," where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: "Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races," he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking "withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens." The capstone of <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's "double consciousness," which he described as "a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder." Thanks to W.E.B. Du Bois' commitment and foresight--and the intellectual excellence expressed in this timeless literary gem--black Americans can today look in the mirror and rejoice in their beautiful black, brown, and beige reflections. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line." Thus speaks W.E.B. Du Bois in <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i>, one of the most prophetic and influental works in American literature. In this eloquent collection of essays, first published in 1903, Du Bois dares as no one has before to describe the magnitude of American racism and demand an end to it. He draws on his own life for illustration, from his early experiences teaching in the hills of Tennessee to the death of his infant son and his historic break with the conciliatory position of Booker T. Washington.<p></p><p>Far ahead of its time, <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i> both anticipated and inspired much of the black conciousness and activism of the 1960's and is a classic in the literature of civil rights. The elegance of DuBois's prose and the passion of his message are as crucial today as they were upon the book's first publication.</p></p><h2>Russian Tortoises (Complete Herp Care)</h2><p>For both beginner and advanced hobbyists comes a brand new reptile and amphibian series.

Now we deliver this treasure, this Key, to this suffering humanity. Many will read this book; however, few will comprehend it. The topic of this book is exclusively sexual magic. Indeed, those who are accustomed to read thousands of books out of pure intellectual curiosity will assuredly miss the opportunity to study this book in depth. It is worthless to read this book in a hurry. Those who proceed likewise are mistaken. It is necessary to profoundly study this book and to totally comprehend it, not only with the intellect but in all the levels of the mind. The intellect is only a small fraction of the mind. The intellect is not the whole mind. Therefore, whosoever understands this book only with the intellect has not understood it. Only with internal meditation is it possible to understand this book in all the levels of the mind. It is urgent to practice sexual magic in order to attain Christification. The reader will discover the supreme Key of intimate Self-realization within this book. We are not against any Religion, School, Sect, Order or Lodge because we know that all religious forms are manifestations of the Great Cosmic Universal Infinite Religion latent in every atom of the Cosmos. We just teach the synthesis of all Religions, Schools, Orders, Lodges and beliefs. Our doctrine is the Doctrine of the Synthesis. Sexual magic is practiced in esoteric Christianity. Sexual magic is practiced in Zen Buddhism. Sexual magic is practiced amongst the Initiated Yogis. Sexual magic is practiced amongst the Mohammedan Sufis. Sexual magic was practiced in the Initiatic Colleges of Troy, Egypt, Rome, Carthage, Eleusis. Sexual magic was practiced by the mysterious Maya, Aztec, Inca, Druids, etc. Therefore, sexual magic and the Cosmic Christ are the synthesis of all religions, schools and sects. We teach the Doctrine of the Synthesis. This doctrine could never be contrary to the diverse religious forms. Our teachings are found within all religions, schools and beliefs. If the reader makes a serious study of all the religions of the world, he will discover the phallus and uterus as the synthesis of all Mysteries. There has never been any authentic religion or school of mysteries where the Cosmic Christ and the mysteries of sex were absent. The Doctrine of the Synthesis cannot harm anyone, because it is the synthesis of all. We invite the devotees of all cults, schools and beliefs to make a comparative study of religions. We invite the students of all the diverse systems of intimate self-education to study the sexual esoterism from all the secret Schools of Mysteries. We invite all Yogis to study Sexual Yoga and White Tantra from India, without which no Yogi is able to attain absolute liberation. Whatever be the name, sexual magic and Christ are the synthesis of all esoteric studies, religious forms, or educational systems. The attacks of which we have been victims, the persecutions, anathemas, and excommunications etc., are because of ignorance and lack of study. Any religious form or esoteric system enriches itself with the synthesis. The synthesis cannot harm anyone. This is the Doctrine of the Synthesis. We intensely love all religious forms. We know that all religious forms are the loving manifestation of the Great Cosmic Universal Religion. The supreme religious synthesis is found within the Perfect Matrimony. God is Love and Wisdom. The ultimate synthesis of all Lodges, Orders, Schools, Sects, systems and methods of intimate Self-realization, from the East as from the West, from the North as from the South, is found within Christ and within sex.

They talk about what they have always talked about, only they go deeper and more honest: with outrageous humor they try to mitigate pain. Intimate and uncensored sharing, the kind of connection women prize, is at the heart of this deeply moving novel about the grit and power of female friends.<br>Ann and Ruth have always talked as only great friends can--honestly, and about everything: husbands and marriages, sex lives and children, their work, their hopes, their disappointments, and their dreams. For Ann, cautious and conventional, her closeness to the outspoken and eccentric Ruth brings about discovery and liberation, a chance to say whatever she wants, and, most important, under the insistent tutelage of Ruth, to become herself. Over the years, the women have shared recipes, quilting patterns, child care, delicate and dangerous secrets. Each rests secure in the knowledge that they will be friends forever. Then something happens that will change their lives forever, and the women begin to share something more profound than either of them might have predicted.<br>Written with an unerring ear for how women talk, laugh, and cry together, and with a gift for capturing the uniqueness of personality, <i>Talk Before Sleep</i> is sure to find a place in readers' hearts.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>"You'll want to give a copy to&nbsp;&nbsp;every good woman friend you have." -- <i>The Charlotte Observer</i> <br> <br>"Entertaining, finely crafted Elizabeth Berg tackles serious&nbsp;&nbsp;issues with grace" -- <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br> <br>"Tender and irreverant by turns, it offers mature intelligent and&nbsp;&nbsp;buoyant spirit, like a very good&nbsp;&nbsp;friend." -- <i>Houston Post</i> <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Paperback edition.</i>Elizabeth Berg&#x2019;s novels <i>Open House</i>, <i>The Pull of the Moon</i>, <i>Range of Motion</i>, <i>What We<br> Keep</i>, <i>Never Change</i>, and <i>Until the Real Thing Comes Along</i> were bestsellers. <i>Durable<br> Goods</i> and <i>Joy School</i> were selected as ALA Best Books of the Year. <i>Talk Before Sleep</i> was<br> an ABBY finalist and a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.

Good Men: How Catholic Seminaries Turned Away Two Generations of Vocations From the Priesthood</h2><p>In this explosive new book, investigative reporter Michael S.

Good Men</i>, author Michael Rose interviewed over 125 seminarians to examine the reasons why the Catholic Church now faces an alarming shortage of priests. (From 1966 to 1999 the number of seminarians dropped from 39,638 to 4,826.) For years this dramatic decline has been blamed on materialism, growing skepticism, and the perceived "unrealistic expectation" of celibacy. Yet Rose believes that the main reason for the priest shortage is the ambivalence and dissent within the Catholic Church itself. "Dissent kills vocations," he writes. "It's merely common sense that says people generally do not want to give themselves to an organization whose leaders constantly bemoan its basic structure." Of course he also points to the "appalling" sexual abuses within the church as a strong deterrent. Interestingly, though, Rose (<i>Ugly as Sin</i>) believes that the solution is not to reconsider the demands of celibacy or refashion doctrine to make it more palatable to modern people. Rather, he points out that the more successful seminaries (the ones that attract and keep candidates) are not the politically correct reformist, but the more orthodox. According to Rose, "It boils down to a generation gap of sorts, one that pits the aging radical reformer against the young, pious conservative." Regardless of where you fall on this continuum, Rose's assessment adds a provocative voice to a crucial discussion. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>MICHAEL S.

Incorporating the latest advances in brain scanning and neuroscience, Dutton demonstrates that the brilliant neurosurgeon who lacks empathy has more in common with a Ted Bundy who kills for pleasure than we may wish to admit, and that a mugger in a dimly lit parking lot may well, in fact, have the same nerveless poise as a titan of industry.</p><p>Dutton argues that there are indeed "functional psychopaths" among us&#x2015;different from their murderous counterparts&#x2015;who use their detached, unflinching, and charismatic personalities to succeed in mainstream society, and that shockingly, in some fields, the more "psychopathic" people are, the more likely they are to succeed. Dutton deconstructs this often misunderstood diagnosis through bold on-the-ground reporting and original scientific research as he mingles with the criminally insane in a high-security ward, shares a drink with one of the world's most successful con artists, and undergoes transcranial magnetic stimulation to discover firsthand exactly how it feels to see through the eyes of a psychopath.</p><p>As Dutton develops his theory that we all possess psychopathic tendencies, he puts forward the argument that society as a whole is more psychopathic than ever: after all, psychopaths tend to be fearless, confident, charming, ruthless, and focused&#x2015;qualities that are tailor-made for success in the twenty-first century. Provocative at every turn, <i>The Wisdom of Psychopaths </i>is a riveting adventure that reveals that it's our much-maligned dark side that often conceals the trump cards of success.</p></p><p>Dr. Kevin Dutton is a research psychologist at the Calleva Research Centre for Evolution and Human Science, Magdalen College, University of Oxford.

I have important business to conduct on the other side. And I cannot swim in such a strong current.&#x201d; <br>The frog immediately becomes suspicious. <br>&#x201c;Well, Mr. Scorpion,&#x201d; he replies, &#x201c;I appreciate the fact that you have important business to conduct on the other side of the river. But just take a moment to consider your request. You are a scorpion. You have a large stinger at the end of your tail. As soon as I let you onto my back, it is entirely within your nature to sting me.&#x201d; <br>The scorpion, who has anticipated the frog&#x2019;s objections, counters thus: <br>&#x201c;My dear Mr. Frog, your reservations are perfectly reasonable. But it is clearly not in my interest to sting you. I really do need to get to the other side of the river. And I give you my word that no harm will come to you.&#x201d; <br>The frog agrees, reluctantly, that the scorpion has a point. So he allows the fast-talking arthropod to scramble atop his back and hops, without further ado, into the water. <br>At first all is well. Everything goes exactly according to plan. But halfway across, the frog suddenly feels a sharp pain in his back&#x2014;and sees, out of the corner of his eye, the scorpion withdraw his stinger from his hide. A deadening numbness begins to creep into his limbs. <br>&#x201c;You fool!&#x201d; croaks the frog. &#x201c;You said you needed to get to the other side to conduct your business. Now we are both going to die!&#x201d; <br>The scorpion shrugs and does a little jig on the drowning frog&#x2019;s back. <br>&#x201c;Mr. Frog,&#x201d; he replies casually, &#x201c;you said it yourself. I am a scorpion. It is in my nature to sting you.&#x201d; <br>With that, the scorpion and the frog both disappear beneath the murky, muddy waters of the swiftly flowing current. <br>And neither of them is seen again. <br>Bottom Line <br>During his trial in 1980, John Wayne Gacy declared with a sigh that all he was really guilty of was &#x201c;running a cemetery without a license.&#x201d; <br>It was quite a cemetery. Between 1972 and 1978, Gacy had raped and murdered at least thirty-three young men and boys (with an average age of about eighteen) before stuffing them into a crawl space beneath his house. One of his victims, Robert Donnelly, survived Gacy&#x2019;s attentions, but was tortured so mercilessly by his captor that, at several points during his ordeal, he begged him to &#x201c;get it over with&#x201d; and kill him. <br>Gacy was bemused. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting around to it,&#x201d; he replied. <br>I have cradled John Wayne Gacy&#x2019;s brain in my hands. Following his execution in 1994 by lethal injection, Dr. Helen Morrison&#x2014;a witness for the defense at his trial and one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on serial killers&#x2014;had assisted in his autopsy in a Chicago hospital, and then driven back home with his brain jiggling around in a glass jar on the passenger seat of her Buick. She&#x2019;d wanted to find out whether there was anything about it&#x2014;lesions, tumors, disease&#x2014;that made it different from the brains of normal people. <br>Tests revealed nothing unusual. <br>Several years later, over coffee in her office in Chicago, I got to chatting with Dr. Morrison about the significance of her findings, the significance of finding&nbsp;&#x2026; nothing. <br>&#x201c;Does this mean,&#x201d; I asked her, &#x201c;that we&#x2019;re basically all psychopaths deep down? That each of us harbors the propensity to rape, kill, and torture? If there&#x2019;s no difference between my brain and the brain of John Wayne Gacy, then where, precisely, does the difference lie?&#x201d; <br>Morrison hesitated for a moment before highlighting one of the most fundamental truths in neuroscience. <br>&#x201c;A dead brain is very different from a living one,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Outwardly, one brain may look very similar to another, but function completely differently. It&#x2019;s what happens when the lights are on, not off, that tips the balance. Gacy was such an extreme case that I wondered whether there might be something else contributing to his actions&#x2014;some injury or damage to his brain, or some anatomical anomaly. But there wasn&#x2019;t. It was normal. Which just goes to show how complex and impenetrable the brain can sometimes be, how reluctant it is to give up its secrets. How differences in upbringing, say, or other random experiences can cause subtle changes in internal wiring and chemistry which then later account for tectonic shifts in behavior.&#x201d; <br>Morrison&#x2019;s talk that day of lights and tectonic shifts reminded me of a rumor I once heard about Robert Hare, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on psychopaths. Back in the 1990s, Hare submitted a research paper to an academic journal that included the EEG responses of both psychopaths and non-psychopaths as they performed what&#x2019;s known as a lexical decision task. Hare and his team of coauthors showed volunteers a series of letter strings, and then got them to decide as quickly as possible whether or not those strings comprised a word. <br>What they found was astonishing. Whereas normal participants identified emotionally charged words like &#x201c;c-a-n-c-e-r&#x201d; or &#x201c;r-a-p-e&#x201d; more quickly than neutral words like &#x201c;t-r-e-e&#x201d; or &#x201c;p-l-a-t-e,&#x201d; this wasn&#x2019;t the case with psychopaths. To the psychopaths, emotion was irrelevant. The journal rejected the paper. Not it turned out, for its conclusions, but for something even more extraordinary. Some of the EEG patterns, reviewers alleged, were so abnormal they couldn&#x2019;t possibly have come from real people. But of course they had. <br>Intrigued by my talk with Morrison in Chicago about the mysteries and enigmas of the psychopathic mind&#x2014;indeed, about neural recalcitrance in general&#x2014;I visited Hare in Vancouver. Was the rumor true? I asked him. Had the paper really been rejected? If so, what was going on? <br>&#x201c;There are four different kinds of brain waves,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;ranging from beta waves during periods of high alertness, through alpha and theta waves, to delta waves, which accompany deep sleep. These waves reflect the fluctuating levels of electrical activity in the brain at various times. In normal members of the population, theta waves are associated with drowsy, meditative, or sleeping states. Yet in psychopaths they occur during normal waking states&#x2014;even sometimes during states of increased arousal&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;Language, for psychopaths, is only word deep. There&#x2019;s no emotional contouring behind it. A psychopath may say something like &#x2018;I love you,&#x2019; but in reality, it means about as much to him as if he said &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll have a cup of coffee.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x2026; This is one of the reasons why psychopaths remain so cool, calm, and collected under conditions of extreme danger, and why they are so reward-driven and take risks. Their brains, quite literally, are less &#x2018;switched on&#x2019; than the rest of ours.&#x201d; <br>I thought back to Gacy and what I&#x2019;d learned from Dr. Morrison. <br>&#x201c;Kiss my ass,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said as he entered the death chamber. <br>Normal on the outside (Gacy was a pillar of his local community, and on one occasion was even photographed with First Lady Rosalynn Carter), he camouflaged his inner scorpion with an endearing cloak of charm. But it was entirely in his nature to sting you&#x2014;as much as it was to convince you that he wouldn&#x2019;t. <br>Talking the Walk <br>Fabrizio Rossi is thirty-five years old, and used to be a window cleaner. But his predilection for murder eventually got the better of him. And now, would you believe, he &#x201c;does&#x201d; it for a living. <br>As we stand next to each other on a balmy spring morning, poking uneasily around John Wayne Gacy&#x2019;s bedroom, I ask him what the deal is. What is it about psychopaths that we find so irresistible? Why do they fascinate us so much? <br>It&#x2019;s definitely not the first time he&#x2019;s been asked. <br>&#x201c;I think the main thing about psychopaths,&#x201d; says Rossi, &#x201c;is the fact that on the one hand they&#x2019;re so normal, so much like the rest of us&#x2014;but on the other, so different. I mean, Gacy used to dress up as a clown and perform at children&#x2019;s parties&nbsp;&#x2026; That&#x2019;s the thing about psychopaths. On the outside they seem so ordinary. Yet scratch beneath the surface, peek inside the crawl space, as it were, and you never know what you might find.&#x201d; <br>We are not, of course, in Gacy&#x2019;s actual bedroom, But rather, in a mocked-up version of it that comprises an exhibit in what must surely be a candidate for the grisliest museum in the world: the Museum of Serial Killers in Florence. The museum is located on Via Cavour, a ritzy side street within screaming distance of the Duomo. <br>And Fabrizio Rossi curates it. <br>The museum is doing well. And why wouldn&#x2019;t it? They&#x2019;re all there, if you&#x2019;re into that kind of thing. Everyone from Jack the Ripper to Jeffrey Dahmer, from Charles Manson to Ted Bundy. <br>Bundy&#x2019;s an interesting case, I tell Rossi. An eerie portent of the psychopath&#x2019;s hidden powers. A tantalizing pointer to the possibility that, if you look hard enough, there might be more in the crawl space than just <i>dark</i> secrets. <br>He&#x2019;s surprised, to say the least. <br>&#x201c;But Bundy is one of the most notorious serial killers in history,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s one of the museum&#x2019;s biggest attractions. Can there really be anything else except dark secrets?&#x201d; <br>There can. In 2009, twenty years after his execution at Florida State Prison (at the precise time that Bundy was being led to the electric chair, local radio stations urged listeners to turn off household appliances to maximize the power supply), psychologist Angela Book and her colleagues at Brock University in Canada decided to take the icy serial killer at his word. During an interview, Bundy, who staved in the skulls of thirty-five women during a four-year period in the mid-1970s, had claimed, with that boyish, all-American smile of his, that he could tell a &#x201c;good&#x201d; victim simply from the way she walked. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the coldest son of a bitch you&#x2019;ll ever meet,&#x201d; Bundy enunciated. And no one can fault him there. But, Book wondered, might he also have been one of the shrewdest? <br>To find out, she set up a simple experiment. First, she handed out the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale&#x2014;a questionnaire specifically designed to assess psychopathic traits within the general population, as opposed to within a prison or hospital setting&#x2014;to forty-seven male undergraduate students. Then, based on the results, she divided them up into high and low scorers. Next, she videotaped the gait of twelve new participants as they walked down a corridor from one room to another, where they completed a standard demographics questionnaire. The questionnaire included two items: (1) Have you ever been victimized in the past (yes or no)? (2) If yes, how many times has such victimization occurred? <br>Finally, Book presented the twelve videotaped segments to the original forty-seven participants, and issued them a challenge: rate, on a scale of one to ten, how vulnerable to being mugged each of the targets was. The rationale was simple. If Bundy&#x2019;s assertion held water and he really had been able to sniff out weakness from the way his victims walked, then, Book surmised, those who scored high on the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale should be better at judging vulnerability than the low scorers. <br>That, it turned out, was exactly what she found. Moreover, when Book repeated the procedure with clinically diagnosed psychopaths from a maximum-security prison, she found something else. The high-scoring &#x201c;psychopathic&#x201d; undergraduates in the first study might&#x2019;ve been good at identifying weakness, But the <i>clinical</i> psychopaths went one better. They explicitly stated it was because of the way people walked. They, like Bundy, knew precisely what they were looking for. <br>The Men Who Stare at Coats <br>Angela Book&#x2019;s findings are no flash in the pan. Hers is one of a growing number of studies that have, in recent years, begun to show the psychopath in a new, more complex light: a light somewhat different from the lurid shadows cast by newspaper headlines and Hollywood scriptwriters. The news is difficult to swallow. And it goes down the same way here, in this murderous little corner of Florence, as it does nearly everywhere else: with a healthy dose of skepticism. <br>&#x201c;Do you mean,&#x201d; asks Rossi, incredulous, &#x201c;that there are times when it isn&#x2019;t necessarily a bad thing to be a psychopath?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Not only that,&#x201d; I nod, &#x201c;but there are times when it&#x2019;s actually a good thing&#x2014;when, by being a psychopath, you in fact have an advantage over other people.&#x201d; <br>Rossi seems far from convinced, And looking around, it&#x2019;s easy to understand why. Bundy and Gacy aren&#x2019;t exactly the best crowd to fall in with. And, let&#x2019;s face it, when you&#x2019;ve got several dozen others knocking about in the wings, it&#x2019;s difficult to see the positives. But the Museum of Serial Killers doesn&#x2019;t tell the full story. In fact, it&#x2019;s not the half of it. As Helen Morrison eloquently elucidated, the fate of a psychopath depends on a whole range of factors, including genes, family background, education, intelligence, and opportunity&#x2014;and on how they interact. <br>Jim Kouri, vice president of the U.S. National Association of Chiefs of Police, makes a similar point. Traits that are common among psychopathic serial killers, Kouri observes&#x2014;a grandiose sense of self-worth, persuasiveness, superficial charm, ruthlessness, lack of remorse, and the manipulation of others&#x2014;are also shared by politicians and world leaders: individuals running not from the police, but for office. Such a profile, notes Kouri, allows those who present with it to do what they like when they like, completely unfazed by the social, moral, or legal consequences of their actions. <br>If you are born under the right star, for example, and have as much power over the human mind as the moon has over the sea, you might order the genocide of 100,000 Kurds and shuffle to the gallows with such arcane recalcitrance as to elicit, from even your harshest detractors, perverse, unspoken deference. <br>&#x201c;Do not be afraid, doctor,&#x201d; said Saddam Hussein on the scaffold, moments before his execution. &#x201c;This is for men.&#x201d; <br>If you are violent and cunning, like real-life &#x201c;Hannibal Lecter&#x201d; Robert Maudsley, you might lure a fellow inmate to your cell, smash in his skull with a claw hammer, and sample his brains with a spoon as nonchalantly as if you were downing a soft-boiled egg. (Maudsley, by the way, has been cooped up in solitary confinement for the past thirty years, in a bulletproof cage in the basement of Wakefield Prison in England.) <br>Or if you are a brilliant neurosurgeon, ruthlessly cool and focused under pressure, you might, like the man I&#x2019;ll call Dr. Geraghty, try your luck on a completely different playing field: at the remote outposts of twenty-first-century medicine, where risk blows in on hundred-mile-an-hour winds and the oxygen of deliberation is thin: <br>&#x201c;I have no compassion for those whom I operate on,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;That is a luxury I simply cannot afford. In the theater I am reborn: as a cold, heartless machine, totally at one with scalpel, drill and saw. When you&#x2019;re cutting loose and cheating death high above the snowline of the brain, feelings aren&#x2019;t fit for purpose. Emotion is entropy, and seriously bad for business. I&#x2019;ve hunted it down to extinction over the years.&#x201d; <br>Geraghty is one of the U.K.&#x2019;s top neurosurgeons&#x2014;and though on one level his words send a chill down the spine, on another they make perfect sense. Deep in the ghettos of some of the brain&#x2019;s most dangerous neighborhoods, the psychopath is glimpsed as a lone and ruthless predator, a solitary species of transient, deadly allure. No sooner is the word...</p><h2>Corto Maltese: Celtic Tales</h2><p>In this third volume in the definitive English language edition of Hugo Pratt&#x2019;s masterpiece, the action moves from South America to Europe against the backdrop of the First World War. In these six stories Pratt further explores such complicated themes as patriotism and greed, revolution and opportunism, and betrayal and seduction.<br> <br> Events take Corto from a small island in the Venetian lagoon, where he comes face to face with a beautiful blonde spy, to Stonehenge and an adventure with Merlin, Morgana, and Puck. Along the way he meets Ernest Hemingway and future billionaire Aristotle Onassis, Irish revolutionary Banshee O&#x2019;Danann, the legendary Red Baron, and an intense cast of characters who weave in and out of a series of labyrinthine plots and counter-plots.</p><p><b>Hugo Pratt</b>&nbsp;(1927-1995) is considered one of the great graphic novelists in the history of the medium. His strips, graphic works, and watercolors have been exhibited at the Grand Palais in Paris and the Vittoriano in Rome, and a landmark show in 2011 at the Pinacotheque in Paris drew 215,000 visitors, hailing Pratt as "the inventor of the literary comic strip."In this latest escapade featuring Corto Maltese ( The Early Years ), we find the sailor and gentleman of fortune in Asia. It is 1919, Russia is in the throes of revolution, the czarist army in retreat. Imperial China is in ruins, shattered into a horde of private kingdoms ruled by warlords. From Manchuria, Japanese, English and American forces manipulate what's left of the republic to satisfy their own conflicting interests. Acclaimed European cartoonist Pratt sends his celebrated creation Corto Maltese into this political caldron in search of adventure, love and an armored train loaded with czarist gold. Corto and his demented, mercurial ally, Rasputin, find themselves confronting one of the most lunatic generals of the White Army. The black-and-white drawings in this tremendously entertaining strip are historically based and beautifully delineated, expressive yet precise. One of the world's great adventure strips. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The First Mountain Man: Blood on the Divide</h2><p>Preacher joins a wagon train in order to trap the Pardee Brothers--human vultures who prey on innocent pilgrims--and when Preacher&#39;s group gets stuck on the Continental Divide, Preacher is ready and waiting for the Pardees&#39; attack.

Thus there is neither any reason for conceit in deeming oneself better than others nor any reason for self-contempt, thinking of oneself as inferior and unable to reach enlightenment. This seeing is obscured by veils which are removable and do not touch the inherent purity and perfection of the nature of the mind as such. The Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra, one of the Five Treatises said to have been dictated to Asanga by the Bodhisattva Maitreya, presents the Buddha's definitive teachings on how we should understand this ground of enlightenment and clarifies the nature and qualities of buddhahood. <br><br>Jamg�n Kongtr�l Lodro Thaye (1813&#x2013;1899), the profoundly learned and realized master who compiled what are known as the "Five Great Treasures," wrote the outstanding commentary to the Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra translated here. Called <i>The Unassailable Lion's Roar</i>, it presents Maitreya's text as a background for the Mahamudra teachings in a way that is especially clear and easy to understand. <br><br>Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche provided the annotations and the explanations on which the present translation is based. A renowned scholar and highly accomplished yogi, he is a living example of the ongoing tradition of oral transmission. He first visited the West in 1977 at the request of H.H. the Sixteenth Karmapa. <br><br>Rosemarie Fuchs has been a student of Khen Rinpoche since 1978, and this translation was done upon his advice.</p><p>The doctrine of Buddha Nature is foundational to Buddhist philosophy. Every sentient being shares this nature, and because it is our essence and this essence is undefiled, we can remove the stains which prevent us from realizing our full potential.

After a lengthy adoption process, Alina&#x2019;s parents are confounded by their daughter&#x2019;s behavior upon arriving in America. They were aware that she did not speak English and expected some developmental delay, but they did not foresee that the tiny four-year-old would hoard her food, deeply mistrust affection from others, and fail to initiate or respond to most social situations. Most concerning, though, are Alina&#x2019;s rages. When she is frightened, overwhelmed, or confused, Alina lashes out with the strength and stamina of a person many times her size, leading to injury, property destruction, and eventually police intervention and hospitalization. Alina&#x2019;s parents know that their daughter needs help&#x2014;more than they can provide&#x2014;and work endlessly on her behalf. From seeking a diagnosis to advocating for special education services, from keeping Alina safe to discovering her strengths, her parents become her biggest champions. They know there is hope for Alina&#x2014;and their family&#x2014;and will not stop their quest until that hope is realized.

Backpacker Magazine named her as one of its heroes in 2012.From an article by Pete Zimowsky in the Idaho Statesman on May 12, 2011: Idaho&#39;s grand lady of the mountains has come out with the fifth edition of Trails of the Sawtooth and White Cloud Mountains. Margaret Fuller, 76, has been hiking since she was 10. She&#39;s still hitting the trails but laughs and says, I&#39;m not nearly as fast as I used to be. The new edition has GPS coordinates for all trailheads and information onf 128 trails for hiking, horseback riding, and biking in the Sawtooth National Recreation Area... When Fuller first started looking for trails in the Sawtooths in the 1960s, she couldn&#39;t find complete information. So she wrote what she calls the first comprehensive hiking guide for the Sawtooth and White Cloud mountains...... Trails of the Sawtooth and White Cloud Mountains was published in 1979, but she started hiking trails for the book in 1972. It turned out to be a seven-year family project for Fuller, her husband Wayne, and their five children. They didn&#39;t think twice about backpacking with youngsters, and at one point had two kids sleeping in one sleeping bag. Being one of the first in-depth hiking guides, the book caused controversy when it was published because critics said it gave away too many places that some Idahoans wanted to keep secret. Things have changed. There&#39;s an insatiable appetite among consumers for guidebooks, maps, magazine stories, and Internet information on everything to do with the outdoors... --The Idaho Statesman, May 12, 2011</p><h2>Gemstones of the World</h2><p>This is the standard reference for over twenty years, now completely revised and updated with many new illustrations. &#34;Gemstones of the World&#34; is the most comprehensive and informative colour manual of the world&#39;s gemstones and includes more than 1,400 examples.

Throughout this book, the author puts us in touch with the quintesential aspects of Chinese taste. His chapter on textiles covers the whole development of this craft from the Shang dynasty onwards. That on glass and painting on glass is a pioneering account of a type of craft little known to the West. In writing about carvings in ivory and rhinoceros horn he deals expertly with a subject which, of all those he handles, is probably the most familaiar to the West and held in the greatest affection. Among other areas covered in detail are snuff bottles and inkstones. The outstanding skill and sensitivity manifested in the works of these artists are a source of constant delight. The illustrations in color and monochrome reveal the exquisitely fine workmanship in the textiles, the rich and subtle colors of the carvings. These superb examples of Chinese artworks are from museums and private collections in the United States and Europe, and the Far East. This third and final book of a comprehensive series on the many-sided facets of Chinese art and artisanship throughout the centuries comnpletes a detailed study of minor or decorative Chinese arts in which Mr. Jenyns shows the development and meaning of the artistry and craftsmanship of Chinese masters and how deeply they influenced Western art and fashions.</p><p></p><h2>The King&#39;s Daughter</h2><p>While laying the groundwork to overthrow Queen Mary and bring Elizabeth to power, bride-to-be Isabel Thornleigh discovers secrets in her own family that force her to turn to a Spanish soldier of fortune for help--an alliance that changes the course of history.

His career as a botanist began at the age of six, learning to identify plants on country walks and after graduating in botany from London University, he spent most of his working life teaching there until retirement in 1981. This remains his most popular book, which took over 20 years to write and represents a lifetime&#39;s experience of plant identification.

He worked with Andrew Ellicott, the surveyor appointed by George Washington, to lay out the boundaries of Washington, D.C. A great deal of information and a long period of time have been compressed and simplified in an attempt to make Banneker's life and contributions accessible to young readers. Dialogue has been added, most likely for the same reason, although it is sometimes jarring. For example, when Benjamin begins the Quaker school, his grandmother's musing portends the boy's future: " 'Benjie,' she said, 'I wonder what great things you're going to do some day. And I wonder how you can do them on a tobacco farm.' " Little information is given on the restrictive laws of 18th-Century America which would help place Banneker in an appropriate context. No sources are cited with the exception of an acknowledgement to Silvio Bedini, the author of a definitive adult biography entitled The Life of Benjamin Banneker (Landmark, 1984).

"Is immigration really a 'national crisis'? Chac�n and Davis attack the question by revealing the disturbing, centuries-old context for the cross-border working-class, and the resurgence of reactionary anti-immigrant politics and racist vigilante violence.

More can be gained from the photographs than from the choppy, sometimes wordy, texts. Yellow "Weapon Fact" boxes are supposed to give additional information, but one-third of them don't even mention weapons. Some of the full-page vintage photos are grainy. The smaller gallery photos are clearer. There isn't much here except for a few photos that are available elsewhere.

Over the next few years, supply ships from England became the colony's lifeline, as they brought much-needed stores of food and carried back offerings from the new land, as well as the settlers' homesick letters. <br> Conditions began to improve when Captain John Smith was elected president of the colony, and James Towne soon doubled in size. While some of the settlers had been reluctant to work, Smith required participation from all, and the colonists began to take pride in improving their conditions. Furthermore, by learning the native language and befriending a Native American girl named Pocahontas, Smith was able to establish, temporarily, an uneasy peace between the settlers and the natives whose land they had taken. <br> As new settlers began to arrive from England though, the resources of the budding colony were strained, and in the autumn of 1609 the colony suffered a Starving Time. Deciding to abandon James Towne at last, the colonists headed back toward England, only to have their journey intercepted by a messenger, who informed the settlers that new leaders sent by the King were due to arrive in the flailing colony any day, and urged them to return. <br> Not for long after their arrival, the discouraged James Towne colonists were met by a new governor and a ship full of healthy passengers with enough supplies and hope to work together to ensure James Towne's survival.</p><p><b>Marcia Sewall's</b>&nbsp;children's books have been among the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Best Illustrated, the ALA Notables, and&nbsp;<i>School Library Journal</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Booklist</i>&nbsp;best books of the year.

She is a lifelong resident of New England.<p>Gr 3-5-Using the same format as in the People of the Breaking Day (Atheneum, 1990), Sewall offers a glimpse into life in the Jamestown Colony. Told through the voice of an 18-year-old carpenter, the narrative opens with a description of the departure of three ships from England on December 20, 1606. Readers follow the voyagers as they sail across the Atlantic, find landfall, establish a settlement, and meet with the native people. The clear narration retains the tone of 17th-century English. Short paragraphs, often defined by dates, tell of the difficult early years of the settlement. Quotes from diaries and letters (though not always identified as such) with authors and dates are often found at the bottom of the pages. Unfortunately, the narrative is somewhat dry and readers may not get a real sense of what it was like to be one of the first inhabitants of the settlement. Large, fluid watercolor-and-sepia-ink paintings illustrate the book. A few are unclear; the painting depicting Captain Smith's encounter with the Great Powhatan and Pocahontas would be difficult to decipher without the accompanying text. Helpful end material includes a map, glossary, list of characters, and information regarding the three ships. While Sewall's book offers a different angle than "The Thirteen Colonies" series (Children's) and is more attractive than the "Library of the 13 Colonies and the Lost Colony" series (Rosen), these titles offer a more comprehensive treatment of the subject.

If the mind is the brain, and therefore a physical object subject to deterministic laws, how can we have free will? If most of our thoughts and impulses are unconscious, how can we be morally responsible for what we do? If brains and bodies undergo relentless change, how can our identities be constant? <i>The Problem of the Soul</i> shows the way out of these paradoxes. Framing the conflict in terms of two dominant visions of the mind--the "manifest image" of humanistic philosophy and theology, and the scientific image--Owen Flanagan demonstrates that there is common ground, and that we need not give up our ideas of moral responsibility and personal freedom in order to have an empirically sound view of the human mind. This is a profoundly relevant work of philosophy for the common reader.</p><p><b>Owen Flanagan</b> is James B. Duke Professor of Philosophy and Chairman of the Philosophy Department at Duke University. The author of the classic <i>Consciousness Reconsidered</i>, he lives in Durham, North Carolina.&#34;Flanagan is a sparkling writer, leavening rigorous philosophical exposition with intimate personal disclosures, vivid examples, and humor.

Xenophobia is rampant and commonly reflected in elections across the continent. Great Britain may hold a referendum on whether to abandon the union altogether. Spurred by anti-EU sentiments due to the euro crisis, national interests conflict with a shared vision for the future of Europe. Is it too late to preserve the union that generated unprecedented peace for more than half a century?<br><br>This is no mere academic question with limited importance for America and the rest of the world. In the past decade, the EU has declined from a unified global power to a fractious confederation of states with staggering unemployment resentfully seeking relief from a reluctant Germany. If the EU collapses and the former member states are transformed again from partners into rivals, the US and the world will confront the serious economic and political consequences that follow.<br><br>In a series of revealing interviews conducted by Dr. Gregor Peter Schmitz, George Soros&#x2014;a man of vast European experience whose personal past informs his present concerns&#x2014;offers trenchant commentary and concise, prescriptive advice: The euro crisis was not an inevitable consequence of integration, but a result of avoidable mistakes in politics, economics, and finance; and excessive faith in the self-regulating financial markets that Soros calls market fundamentalism inspired flawed institutional structures that call out for reform. Despite the considerable perils of this period, George Soros maintains his faith in the European Union as a model of open society.

The great elven cities are little more than prison camps. Elven slaves are forced to destroy their beloved rainforest to harvest timber for their masters. The enemy has no mercy, no honor, and little skill in battle. The enemy is Man. Those few elves who remain free are fragmented, in squabbling factions, and they must unite before they can take a stand against Man. Many believe that the battle is already lost, but Auum is not one of them. He knows Men's numbers are great but their tactics are weak; he knows Men think the Elves are already beaten; he is convinced that his people must fight now, or see their race destroyed. Takaar disagrees. He believes Elven salvation lies in unlocking their magic, not in fighting pitched battles against Man. He is determined to save his people too, but his tactics are entirely different&#x2014;and if some Elves must die now to ensure Calaius will be free of Man in the future, it's a sacrifice he is willing to make. The Elves must choose their sides. Whatever they decide, victory will win their freedom, and failure will mean extermination.</p><p><b>James Barclay</b> is the author of the trilogies Chronicles of the Raven, which includes<i> Dawnthief</i> and <i>Noonshade</i>,&nbsp;and Legends of the Raven, which includes <i>Elfsorrow</i>."A&nbsp;phenomenally good book.

His debut novel A MAN CALLED OVE was a number 1 bestseller across Scandinavia, has sold over one million copies worldwide, was a Richard &amp; Judy summer read in the UK and an instant New York Times paperback bestseller, and has been made into an acclaimed film.

He&#x2019;s the kind of man who points at people he doesn&#x2019;t like the look of, as if they were burglars and his forefinger a policeman&#x2019;s flashlight. He stands at the counter of a shop where owners of Japanese cars come to purchase white cables. Ove eyes the sales assistant for a long time before shaking a medium-sized white box at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;So this is one of those O-Pads, is it?&#x201d; he demands.<br> <br>The assistant, a young man with a single-digit body mass index, looks ill at ease. He visibly struggles to control his urge to snatch the box out of Ove&#x2019;s hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, exactly. An iPad. Do you think you could stop shaking it like that . . . ?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove gives the box a skeptical glance, as if it&#x2019;s a highly dubious sort of box, a box that rides a scooter and wears tracksuit pants and just called Ove &#x201c;my friend&#x201d; before offering to sell him a watch.<br> <br>&#x201c;I see. So it&#x2019;s a computer, yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>The sales assistant nods. Then hesitates and quickly shakes his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes . . . or, what I mean is, it&#x2019;s an iPad. Some people call it a &#x2018;tablet&#x2019; and others call it a &#x2018;surfing device.&#x2019; There are different ways of looking at it. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove looks at the sales assistant as if he has just spoken backwards, before shaking the box again.<br> <br>&#x201c;But is it good, this thing?&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant nods confusedly. &#x201c;Yes. Or . . . How do you mean?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove sighs and starts talking slowly, articulating his words as if the only problem here is his adversary&#x2019;s impaired hearing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is. It. Goooood? Is it a good computer?&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant scratches his chin.<br> <br>&#x201c;I mean . . . yeah . . . it&#x2019;s really good . . . but it depends what sort of computer you want.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove glares at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want a computer! A normal bloody computer!&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence descends over the two men for a short while. The assistant clears his throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . it isn&#x2019;t really a normal computer. Maybe you&#x2019;d rather have a . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant stops and seems to be looking for a word that falls within the bounds of comprehension of the man facing him. Then he clears his throat again and says:<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . a laptop?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove shakes his head wildly and leans menacingly over the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I don&#x2019;t want a &#x2018;laptop.&#x2019; I want a computer.&#x201d;<br> <br>The assistant nods pedagogically.<br> <br>&#x201c;A laptop is a computer.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove, insulted, glares at him and stabs his forefinger at the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think I don&#x2019;t know that!&#x201d;<br> <br>Another silence, as if two gunmen have suddenly realized they have forgotten to bring their pistols. Ove looks at the box for a long time, as though he&#x2019;s waiting for it to make a confession.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where does the keyboard pull out?&#x201d; he mutters eventually.<br> <br>The sales assistant rubs his palms against the edge of the counter and shifts his weight nervously from foot to foot, as young men employed in retail outlets often do when they begin to understand that something is going to take considerably more time than they had initially hoped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, this one doesn&#x2019;t actually have a keyboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove does something with his eyebrows. &#x201c;Ah, of course,&#x201d; he splutters. &#x201c;Because you have to buy it as an &#x2018;extra,&#x2019; don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, what I mean is that the computer doesn&#x2019;t have a separate keyboard. You control everything from the screen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove shakes his head in disbelief, as if he&#x2019;s just witnessed the sales assistant walking around the counter and licking the glass-fronted display cabinet.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I have to have a keyboard. You do understand that?&#x201d;<br> <br>The young man sighs deeply, as if patiently counting to ten.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. I understand. In that case I don&#x2019;t think you should go for this computer. I think you should buy something like a MacBook instead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A McBook?&#x201d; Ove says, far from convinced. &#x201c;Is that one of those blessed &#x2018;eReaders&#x2019; everyone&#x2019;s talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. A MacBook is a . . . it&#x2019;s a . . . laptop, with a keyboard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d; Ove hisses. He looks around the shop for a moment. &#x201c;So are they any good, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>The sales assistant looks down at the counter in a way that seems to reveal a fiercely yet barely controlled desire to begin clawing his own face. Then he suddenly brightens, flashing an energetic smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what? Let me see if my colleague has finished with his customer, so he can come and give you a demonstration.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove checks his watch and grudgingly agrees, reminding the assistant that some people have better things to do than stand around all day waiting. The assistant gives him a quick nod, then disappears and comes back after a few moments with a colleague. The colleague looks very happy, as people do when they have not been working for a sufficient stretch of time as sales assistants.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, how can I help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ove drills his police-flashlight finger into the counter.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want a computer!&#x201d;<br> <br>The colleague no longer looks quite as happy. He gives the first sales assistant an insinuating glance as if to say he&#x2019;ll pay him back for this.<br> <br>In the meantime the first sales assistant mutters, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take anymore, I&#x2019;m going for lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lunch,&#x201d; snorts Ove. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the only thing people care about nowadays.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d; says the colleague and turns around.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lunch!&#x201d; He sneers, then tosses the box onto the counter and swiftly walks out.</p><h2>On Eagle&#39;s Beak: A History of the Montauk Point Lighthouse</h2><p><br><br><b>New York's First Lighthouse!</b><br><br>The Montauk Point Lighthouse has at last been given the thorough account of its history that it deserves.

As a child, his parents found him merely exasperating. As an adult, and interim chair of the English Department, he is careening out of control. Half in love with three women, unable to understand his daughter or come to terms with his father, Hank has a dangerous philosophy that life, even an academic life, could be simpler, and that endless discussions and negotiation might profitably be replaced by provocation or simple extortion. He is a man in thrall to the perversity principle. Packed with memorable characters and scenes of pure genius, &#34;Straight Man&#34; is exhilarating, hilarious and deeply moving - an unforgettable portrait of a middle aged man caught somewhere between cause and effect.</p><p>First Jane Smiley came out of the comedy closet with <i>Moo</i>, a campus satire par excellence, and now Richard Russo has gotten in on the groves-of-academe game. <i>Straight Man</i> is hilarious sport, with a serious side. William Henry Devereaux Jr., is almost 50 and stuck forever as chair of English at West Central Pennsylvania University. It is April and fear of layoffs--even among the tenured--has reached mock-epic proportions; Hank has yet to receive his department budget and finds himself increasingly offering comments such as "Always understate necrophilia" to his writing students. Then there are his possible prostate problems and the prospect of his father's arrival. Devereaux Sr., "then and now, an academic opportunist," has always been a high-profile professor and a low-profile parent. <p> Though Hank tries to apply William of Occam's rational approach (choose simplicity) to each increasingly absurd situation, and even has a dog named after the philosopher, he does seem to cause most of his own enormous difficulties. Not least when he grabs a goose and threatens to off a duck (sic) a day until he gets his budget. The fact that he is also wearing a fake nose and glasses and doing so in front of a TV camera complicates matters even further. Hank tries to explain to one class that comedy and tragedy don't go together, but finds the argument "runs contrary to their experience. Indeed it may run contrary to my own." It runs decidedly against Richard Russo's approach in <i>Straight Man,</i> and the result is a hilarious and touching novel.</p>"Russo is a master craftsman ...

Was there always an alluring glint in his dark eyes? But the duke has a notoriously scandalous reputation, and Meriel will not let herself succumb.</p><p>Masquerading as the duke was not the simple solution Richard O'Neill had envisioned. When his ailing half-brother, the real duke, asked him to protect his young heir from a greedy enemy, Richard agreed. But he never thought he'd be attracted to the inquisitive governess, or that each moment in her intoxicating presence would tempt him beyond all reason. And letting down his guard could prove dangerous . . . especially to Richard's own heart.</p></p><p><p>After a detour through fitness instructing and computer programming, Gayle Callen found the life she'd always dreamed of as a romance writer.

Marshall graduated from Columbia University, the U.S. Army&#39;s Armored Force Officer Candidate School, and its Military Intelligence School. He served as a captain in the Military Intelligence Service of the U.S. Army during World War II and was decorated for his rapid exploitation of captured enemy maps, field orders, and pertinent documents. At the war&#39;s end, he supervised interrogation in POW, internment, and war crime camps. Now retired, he lives with his wife in Douglastown, New York.Marshall claims to have broken the news to the world in 1945 that Rommel had not died of wounds, as claimed by Nazi propaganda, but had been forced to commit suicide. Marshall was the G-2 intelligence officer who first interviewed Rommel's widow. He originally wrote manuscript in 1945-46, but it was lost until now. While probably significant in 1946, this book suffers from trying to pull together the recollections of a 40-year-old story. Because there are no notes or bibliography, the reader has to take Marshall's word for events and conversations that happened long ago. One unexpected bonus is the final few chapters, which give an interesting account of life in occupied Germany at the conclusion of the war. Libraries with strong World War II collections may wish to purchase this, but most would be better off with David Fraser's Knight's Cross: A Life of Field Marshall Erwin Rommel (HarperCollins, 1993).<br><i>Randall L.

Without Byzantium, the works of Homer and Herodotus, Plato and Aristotle, Sophocles and Aeschylus, would never have survived. Yet very few of us have any idea of the enormous debt we owe them.<br><br>The story of Byzantium is a real-life adventure of electrifying ideas, high drama, colorful characters, and inspiring feats of daring. In Sailing from Byzantium, Colin Wells tells of the missionaries, mystics, philosophers, and artists who against great odds and often at peril of their own lives spread Greek ideas to the Italians, the Arabs, and the Slavs.<br><br>Their heroic efforts inspired the Renaissance, the golden age of Islamic learning, and Russian Orthodox Christianity, which came complete with a new alphabet, architecture, and one of the world&#x2019;s greatest artistic traditions. <br><br>The story&#x2019;s central reference point is an arcane squabble called the Hesychast controversy that pitted humanist scholars led by the brilliant, acerbic intellectual Barlaam against the powerful monks of Mount Athos led by the stern Gregory Palamas, who denounced &#x201c;pagan&#x201d; rationalism in favor of Christian mysticism.<br><br>Within a few decades, the light of Byzantium would be extinguished forever by the invading Turks, but not before the humanists found a safe haven for Greek literature. The controversy of rationalism versus faith would continue to be argued by some of history&#x2019;s greatest minds. <br><br>Fast-paced, compulsively readable, and filled with fascinating insights, <b>Sailing from Byzantium</b> is one of the great historical dramas&#x2013;the gripping story of how the flame of civilization was saved and passed on.</p><p>Colin Wells has studied with eminent Byzantinist Speros Vryonis Jr. at UCLA and holds an M.A. from Oxford University in Greats (Greek and Latin language and literature). He has written numerous articles on world history and culture for over a decade. He lives in upstate New York.<i>Chapter One</i><br> Toward a Parting of the Ways<br><br> Travel to Italy, and you&#x2019;ll find that Byzantium is never more than a stone&#x2019;s throw away. Even that short distance is closed, discreetly but persistently, when you step into the painting galleries, the museums, and especially the churches. In these places Byzantium swirls gently around you like a mist, muting the hum of German, American, and Japanese voices: in Venice&#x2019;s Basilica di San Marco, for example, built with the help of Byzantine artisans, modeled on Constantinople&#x2019;s long-lost Church of the Holy Apostles, and adorned with loot from Venice&#x2019;s conquest of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade; or in San Vitale at Ravenna, where the famous mosaics of the Byzantine emperor Justinian and his wife, the notorious stripper-turned-empress Theodora, each with their retinues, gaze limpidly at each other across fifteen yards of apse and as many centuries.<br><br> Byzantium comes to life in the monuments of Italy as nowhere else in Europe, and in the monuments of Ravenna as nowhere else in Italy. Venice certainly has more of a Byzantine feel today, but it&#x2019;s the feel of a much later period, and anyway Venice&#x2019;s Byzantium is generally either lifted or copied. Ravenna&#x2019;s Byzantium is primal. Built long before the Venetians sank their first piling, its swampy environs more easily defensible than Rome, Ravenna in the early Middle Ages was the capital of the Byzantine administration in Italy.<br><br> Then came the barbarians&#x2014;Vandals, Goths, and others&#x2014;whose turbulent arrival and usurpation of political power we know as &#x201c;the fall of Rome.&#x201d; Determined to reclaim the lost territory, in the middle of the sixth century Justinian carried out a ruthless and grueling Reconquest of Italy and other parts of the Western empire. Having completed the long war, he built San Vitale to celebrate his victory.<br><br> A few minutes&#x2019; walk from San Vitale, mosaics in the church of Sant&#x2019;Apollinare Nuovo offer a very different message from the bland, assertive gaze of the imperial couple and their retinues. Built by the Gothic king and statesman Theoderic the Great just before Justinian came to the throne, Sant&#x2019;Apollinare Nuovo precedes San Vitale by a generation. It proclaims in the most buoyant terms the Goths&#x2019; arrival on the Roman scene. Two extended series of mosaics face each other on the church&#x2019;s long interior walls: a grand cityscape of Ravenna featuring Theoderic&#x2019;s palace on the south wall and a view of the nearby port of Classis on the north wall.<br><br> The cityscape on the south wall once included portraits of Goths, members of Theoderic&#x2019;s Amal dynasty or other nobles; after the Reconquest, just as they had painstakingly rooted the Goths out of Italy, the Byzantines prised out and replaced the mosaic stones constituting the Gothic figures. A visitor today can clearly make out the dappled areas where the new stones, which don&#x2019;t quite match, were applied. On the edges of columns depicted next to the palace, between which billowing curtains replaced the original Gothic figures leaning against them, you can still see a few fingers: they are remains left by the revision, too delicately embedded to chip away from the mosaic columns, so that it looks as if the last of the Goths hide there behind them, waiting to spring out through the curtains. On the wall nearby, what appears to be a portrait of Theoderic has had his name excised from the legend and that of Justinian written in.<br><br> Sant&#x2019;Apollinare Nuovo reflected a widespread state of affairs in Europe at the time, a civilization really, but a clumpy one that scholars have given the name &#x201c;sub-Roman&#x201d;: the part-Roman, part-barbarian cluster of cultures, like the Goths, that arose in the West over the fragmented course of the fourth and fifth centuries. These yeasty little worlds were the earliest signs of the Western Europe to come, and appeared first in the former Roman colonies from Spain through Gaul to Germany and down into the Balkans, and then eventually in Italy itself.<br><br> In Italy under the Goths, however, there wouldn&#x2019;t be time for the brew to ferment properly; the vessel would soon be shattered for good by Justinian&#x2019;s vain attempt to grab it back. Not only the Goths would suffer, for virtually the entire peninsula would be wrecked, its people deeply traumatized by what was theoretically their rescue.<br><br> It was not the barbarian invasions at all, but the havoc of this brutal Byzantine Reconquest that ended the ancient world in the West.<br><br> Yet, Theoderic&#x2019;s reign in Italy, which came right before the Reconquest, had an air of optimism. The early fifth century had been violent and unsettling in the West, with Roman rule petering out and the incoming barbarians taking over in uneasy partnership with the now rudderless Roman local elites: Vandals ending up in Africa, Visigoths in Spain, Franks in Gaul. Rome itself was twice laid open to barbarian armies, in 410 and again in 455. The crumbling of Roman power had led a Christian bishop and writer from Roman Africa, one Augustine of Hippo, to turn away from the earthly landscape and point his readers toward the City of God, whose pristine invulnerability stood in splendid contrast to Rome&#x2019;s decay. However, within a few short decades the West turned a corner.<br><br> The year 476, later seen as the end of the empire in the West, in fact passed unremarked by contemporaries. The absence of imperial power had by then lost its fearsome aspect. In the last decade of the century, the Byzantines invited Theoderic&#x2014;himself raised and more or less educated in Constantinople&#x2014;to occupy Italy with his followers. The Goths set themselves up in an uneasy alliance with the old Roman senatorial elites, ruling Italy in the name of good government and of the &#x201c;Roman&#x201d; emperor in Byzantium.<br><br> Procopius, the main Byzantine historian of this era, describes Theoderic as popular and dignified. The Gothic king, we are told, &#x201c;was exceedingly careful to observe justice, he preserved the laws on a sure basis, he protected the land and kept it safe from the barbarians dwelling round about, and attained the highest possible degree of wisdom and manliness.&#x201d; Though in time Theoderic himself could be considered &#x201c;in name a tyrant,&#x201d; Procopius goes on, &#x201c;in fact he was as truly an emperor as any who have distinguished themselves in this office from the beginning.&#x201d;<br><br> Procopius&#x2019; description hints at a few of the intriguing ambiguities that characterize this shifting world. What made a barbarian? A tyrant? A king? Indeed, an emperor? Byzantines and Italians would soon begin to come up with conflicting answers to such questions as they slowly went their separate ways. The long divergence&#x2014;marked by tiny, imperceptible steps rather than huge, irrevocable ones&#x2014;stretched over the whole thousand-year history of Byzantium.<br><br> Boethius and Cassiodorus<br><br> To start us on the path to this parting of the ways, we shall call on two learned Roman gentlemen of Theoderic&#x2019;s day, Boethius and Cassiodorus. Like double-faced Janus, the Roman god of arrivals and departures, each looks in two directions at once, harkening back to the fading world of antiquity and beckoning us forward into the emerging world of the Middle Ages.<br><br> Modern scholars invariably introduce Boethius as &#x201c;the last of the Romans and the first of the Scholastics.&#x201d;* What this comes down to is that Boethius was the last Western European of cultural consequence to know Greek and Greek philosophy for a very long time. He wasn&#x2019;t the absolute last&#x2014;there were a number of stragglers, certainly more than used to be thought&#x2014;but he was the last heavyweight, at the very least until Thomas Aquinas and other Scholastics rediscovered Aristotle starting in the twelfth century, some seven centuries later. Even then few if any Scholastics had Boethius&#x2019; knowledge of ancient Greek; knowledge on that level in the West would have to wait nearly a thousand years, for the Renaissance scholars of quattrocento Florence.&#x2020;<br><br> It isn&#x2019;t certain how Boethius learned his Greek, or where he learned it, though it&#x2019;s possible from hints in the sources that he studied in Athens or Alexandria, or both, as a young man. If so, it wasn&#x2019;t much longer that such sojourns, once standard practice for a vanishing Mediterranean-wide<br><br> * Scholasticism was the major intellectual movement in Europe before the rise of humanism, and it, too, was stimulated by the discovery of ancient literature&#x2014;in this case, the partial recovery of Aristotle&#x2019;s thought in the twelfth century. It is closely associated with the rise of universities or &#x201c;schools.&#x201d; The greatest scholastic was St. Thomas Aquinas, whose thought was incorporated into Catholic doctrine after his death. Scholasticism stressed the use of reason and dialectical disputation in the formulation of theology.<br><br> &#x2020; Quattrocentro, Italian for &#x201c;four hundreds,&#x201d; refers to the fifteenth century and its cultural innovations in Italy.<br><br> upper class, would be possible. Boethius&#x2019; father died when he was still a boy, and he was adopted by an older relative, Symmachus, a leading figure in Rome who also had strong ties to the literary culture of the Greek East. The refined Symmachus, it turns out, nursed an ambitious plan for restoring Italian familiarity with the Greek classics, and this may have been among his reasons for sponsoring his brilliant younger relative. Under Symmachus&#x2019; guidance, Boethius undertook the almost unbelievably audacious project not only of translating into Latin the entire works of Plato and Aristotle, with commentary, but also of reconciling their often divergent philosophical views....</p><h2>Herakleitos and Diogenes: Translated from the Greek by Guy Davenport</h2><p>All the extant fragments of Herakleitos and a collection of Diogenes&#39; words from various sources. Herakleitos&#39; words, 2500 years old, usually appear in English translated by philosophers as makeshift clusters of nouns and verbs which can then be inspected at length. Here they are translated into plain English and allowed to stand naked and unchaperoned in their native archaic Mediterranean light. The practical words of the Athenian street philosopher Diogenes have never before been extracted from the apocryphal anecdotes in which they have come down to us. They are addressed to humanity at large, and are as sharp and pertinent today as when they were admired by Alexander the Great and Saint Paul.</p><p></p><h2>Usborne Books Build Your Own Robots Sticker Book</h2><p>A construction toy in sticker book form, with lots of robots to build using the stickers provided.

That fascination grew stronger when I studied it again in college, and I&#x2019;ve visited many of the sites where the battles took place. When I visited the Appomattox Court House in Virginia , where General Robert E. Lee signed the documents of surrender before General Ulysses S. Grant, I was struck with the thought of creating a series of novels based upon specific battles in the Civil War. I wanted to mold fictional characters with real ones and fill the stories with romance, suspense, intrigue, and the excitement of battle.

The Lacys make their home in the Colorado Rockies.Web Steele whipped his head around as the flat report of the shot carried to him through the cool mid-October air. Jerking hard on the reins, he drew horse and buggy to a halt in the middle of the road. While the breeze carried the small dust cloud away, he peered past the imposing archway on his left that housed the gate to the Jason Hart plantation.<br><br>Letting his gaze follow the narrow, winding road that led to the mansion and its complex of buildings nestled in a thick stand of trees, he listened for any further sound of trouble. The gunshot seemed to have come from that way, but the pounding of the horse&#x2019;s hooves and the whir of the wheels had suppressed the report enough to make it impossible to be sure.<br><br>Pulling his gaze from the Hart mansion, Steele looked up the road ahead of him as his horse blew and stamped a hoof. The Virginia sky was clear, and the brilliant light of the early afternoon sun revealed no movement in that direction. The John Ruffin plantation lay two miles further on, but the shot was too loud to have come from there.<br><br>Turning around on the seat, he looked down the road behind him. The Steele plantation&#x2013;from which he had just come&#x2013;was nearest, but it also was too far away to have been the source of the shot. There was no sign of life except for the birds that hopped about in the branches of the towering trees that lined both sides of the road. Sunlight danced on the orange and golden leaves as they fluttered in the autumn breeze.<br><br>Steele looked to his right across the rolling hills toward Richmond, but saw nothing moving.<br><br>Suddenly there was a second shot, followed by a third. This time he knew it was coming from the Hart place. The gate beneath the archway was open. Snapping the reins, he sent the horse galloping under the archway, following the narrow, winding road. Another shot rang out, and Web felt a vast hollow in his stomach. Instinct told him that what he had been expecting to happen on both the Ruffin and Hart plantations was now in progress directly ahead of him.<br><br>The mansion was a quarter-mile from the road. As the buggy bounded into the spacious yard, another shot reverberated through the air, the sharp sound coming from the rear. Guiding the horse along the path to the backside of the house, Steele saw Jonas Hart and his two sons hunkered behind an overturned wagon, facing the tool and wood shed, which was close to the barn, about forty yards from the rear of the mansion. There were splintered places on the wagon where bullets had chewed wood.<br><br>Drawing the buggy to a sudden stop, Steele saw Mabel Hart, her oldest daughter, Mary Ann, and daughter-in-law, Chloe, collected on the back porch of the mansion with the butler and the maid. All were wide-eyed with fear.<br><br>As Web Steele jumped out of the buggy, he saw that Jonas was holding a revolver with one hand and a bleeding shoulder with the other. Sons David, twenty-two, and Daniel, twenty-one, were not armed. A group of slaves could be seen at the edge of a clearing some fifty yards further back, where their small cabins huddled in a circle. They too looked frightened.<br><br>Steele knew his instincts were correct. Hart had a slave revolt on his hands. Some of them were holed up in the tool and wood shed, and were armed. The absence of Hart&#x2019;s sixteen-year-old daughter and fourteen-year-old son might mean they were being held hostage.<br><br>Jonas Hart shouted, &#x201c;Web, take cover! We&#x2019;ve got real trouble here!&#x201d;<br><br>Steele took one look at the open window next to the shed&#x2019;s only door and saw the barrel of a revolver glint in the sunlight. He dashed to where Jonas and his sons were clustered behind the overturned wagon. &#x201c;Please tell me that Darrel and Melissa aren&#x2019;t in there!&#x201d;<br><br>A gray pallor was on Jonas Hart&#x2019;s pain-pinched face. Even his lips were colorless. At forty-four, he owned the large plantation and had done well, but Steele knew that Jonas was sometimes unnecessarily harsh with his slaves. He had come close to warning Jonas about it on several occasions, but the man was sixteen years his senior, and he could not bring himself to do it.<br><br>Jonas&#x2019;s voice was tight as he replied, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re in the shed, all right, Web.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How many slaves in there?&#x201d; Web asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Two.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do I know them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. Dexter and Orman.&#x201d;<br><br>Eyeing the blood that was running between Jonas&#x2019;s fingers as he gripped his shoulder, Web said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better get to the house and let Mabel tend to that wound.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Naw,&#x201d; growled the plantation owner, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s only a scratch. It&#x2019;ll be all right. Main thing right now is to bring this situation to an end.&#x201d;<br><br>Looking back toward the shed, Steele said, &#x201c;Dexter and Orman, eh? What do they want?&#x201d;<br><br>Gritting his teeth in pain, Jonas replied, &#x201c;To go free. They say if we&#x2019;ll let them go, they&#x2019;ll release the kids when they&#x2019;re a safe distance from here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What brought this on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing special, they just&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell him the truth, Pa,&#x201d; butted in David, who was slave overseer for his father. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been warning you this was going to happen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d; snapped Jonas. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d be a little more stern with these lazy whelps, it wouldn&#x2019;t make me look so mean when I have to discipline them.&#x201d;<br><br>David Hart had been developing a distaste for slavery for the past two years. He and his father had had many heated discussions about it. Jonas accused him of becoming an &#x201c;abolitionist Yankee&#x201d; in his heart.<br><br>Before David could respond, a voice came from within the shed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;s gettin&#x2019; tired of waitin&#x2019;, Massa Jonas! We want those horses, and we want &#x2018;em right now!&#x201d;<br><br>Web Steele recognized the voice of Dexter, whom he had known for several years. In a half-whisper, he said, &#x201c;Jonas, Dexter knows me well. So does Orman. Do you think it would help if I talk to them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t hurt, that&#x2019;s for sure,&#x201d; spoke up Daniel. &#x201c;Both of them like you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about it, Jonas?&#x201d; pressed Steele.<br><br>&#x201c;Go ahead. Talk to them. Like Dan said, it can&#x2019;t hurt for you<br>to try.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Massa Jonas!&#x201d; bellowed Orman. &#x201c;We saw Massa Web come in. You can do yo&#x2019; talkin&#x2019; later. We want those horses, or we&#x2019;s gonna be forced to hurt dese chillin o&#x2019; yo&#x2019;s!&#x201d;<br><br>Jonas&#x2019;s anger broke. &#x201c;You harm my kids and you&#x2019;ll wish you&#x2019;d never been born, Orman!&#x201d;<br><br>There was no response from the shed. Setting his gaze on Steele, Jonas said, &#x201c;Well, do your talking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;First I have to know what David meant when he told you to be truthful with me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aw, I just found it necessary to give them both a good belt-whipping, that&#x2019;s all. They&#x2019;ve been getting lazier by the day. David won&#x2019;t chastise them, so they just get continually worse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How bad did you whip them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not too bad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you draw blood?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A little.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pa, you expect too much of them,&#x201d; said David. &#x201c;Their bodies get tired like ours do. If you&#x2019;d only ease up on the load&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>Jonas swore, cutting off his elder son. &#x201c;Young and strong as they are, they oughtta be able to do a whole lot more than they&#x2019;ve been doing! There are other slaves on this place who put out more work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, and there are other slaves who&#x2019;ll be doing this same thing shortly, too,&#x201d; responded David.<br><br>&#x201c;Not if I make an example of these two,&#x201d; Jonas growled, sending a heated glance in the direction of the shed.<br><br>At that moment drumming hoof beats were heard in the direction of the road, and seconds later two riders came thundering around the corner of the mansion. The Hart men and Web Steele recognized Reed Exley, slave overseer of the neighboring John Ruffin plantation, and one of the Ruffin slaves, a handsome young man named Mandrake.<br><br>David Hart mumbled, &#x201c;The last person we need here right now is Exley.&#x201d;<br><br>Web agreed. As with most people in the Richmond area, he harbored a deep dislike for Exley, who was married to wealthy John Ruffin&#x2019;s oldest daughter, Elizabeth. Web was engaged to Ruffin&#x2019;s next-oldest daughter, Abby. While courting her for the past year-anda-half, he had gotten to know Exley quite well...much to his sorrow.<br><br>At thirty-one, Reed Exley was three years older than Web. He was short, stocky, blond, and somewhat good-looking; he was also self-centered, greedy, and unprincipled. He had a mean, hair-trigger temper, shifty, ice-blue eyes, and a perpetual cocky smirk. His vile soul was exposed further by his vicious and cruel treatment of the Ruffin slaves. It was because of this treatment that Steele expected an all-out slave rebellion. There had been a few runaways in the past several months, but so far, no actual uprising.<br><br>It was Exley&#x2019;s job to oversee the slaves and to handle the buying and selling of them. Web, who had the same job on his father&#x2019;s plantation, was kind and compassionate with his slaves. His observation of Exley&#x2019;s merciless, inhuman handling of the Ruffin slaves had led him to discuss it on one occasion with Abby&#x2019;s widower father, but it had done no good. John Ruffin had a blind spot when it came to his son-in-law, and because Exley had never abused the slaves before his eyes, he refused to believe it ever happened. Even when Abby and her younger sister, Lynne, told their father of seeing Exley mistreat the slaves, he would not believe it.<br><br>Daniel Hart, who was courting Lynne Ruffin, also disliked Reed Exley. When he saw Exley and Mandrake ride up, he noticed that Exley was wearing a sidearm.<br><br>&#x201c;Better get your head down, Reed!&#x201d; called Jonas. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a couple of slaves with their noses out of joint, and they&#x2019;ve been doing some shooting.&#x201d;<br><br>Exley and Mandrake ran in and hunkered down. &#x201c;Yeah, I heard it,&#x201d; said Reed. &#x201c;I decided to come and see if I could help.&#x201d; As he spoke, he drew his gun, then looked at Jonas&#x2019;s bleeding shoulder. &#x201c;You shot bad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.Mabel can fix me up once this is over.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; queried Exley.<br><br>Jonas gave Exley a brief explanation, naming the two black men who were holding his daughter and son hostage.<br><br>Looking around at the others, Exley saw that the only weapon in the bunch was the revolver in Jonas&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;Well, why don&#x2019;t we get some more guns and rush &#x2018;em?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Web&#x2019;s about to try talking them out,&#x201d; said Jonas.<br><br>Exley gave Web a cold stare. &#x201c;Talk?&#x201d; he spat incredulously. &#x201c;These beasts don&#x2019;t understand talk!&#x201d; Then to Jonas, &#x201c;They both have guns?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d they get &#x2019;em?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no idea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I say let&#x2019;s lay our hands on some more guns and rush &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good way to get Darrel and Melissa killed,&#x201d; Web said. &#x201c;Dexter and Orman are desperate. Put your gun away, Reed, and let me handle this.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Massa Jonas!&#x201d; came Dexter&#x2019;s strained voice. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on? Why&#x2019;s Reed Exley here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He just came because he heard the shooting,&#x201d; Steele answered for Jonas.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah? Then why&#x2019;d he bring that black man with him?&#x201d;<br><br>Web knew Mandrake well. He smiled at him, then turned to Exley and said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good question. Why did you bring Mandrake along?&#x201d;<br><br>A wicked grin spread over Exley&#x2019;s face as he set his icy eyes on Mandrake. In that brief moment, Steele saw a subtle and fleeting manifestation of the man&#x2019;s cruelty. Reed held his hard gaze on Mandrake and replied, &#x201c;Simple, Webster. When I heard the shots, I figured it could be something like this. Mandrake, here, has shown a little too much starch to suit me. The other slaves sort of look to him as their leader. I suppose it&#x2019;s because he&#x2019;s young, full of fire, and has all those muscles. Anyway, I made him come along so if some of Jonas&#x2019;s beasts were gonna get disciplined for startin&#x2019; trouble, he could see first-hand what happens to black boys who revolt against their white masters.&#x201d;<br><br>Trepidation showed on Mandrake&#x2019;s dark features. Daring not to look Reed Exley in the eye, he drew in a long, gravelly breath, passed a glance at Steele, and looked at the ground.<br><br>Suddenly a shot was heard inside the shed. Melissa Hart screamed. A harsh voice blared, &#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s hurt, Massa Jonas! I jus&#x2019; shot through the roof! But Orman and I are tired of waitin&#x2019; for you to let us go. We want those horses now! If&#x2019;n we don&#x2019;t get &#x2018;em, somebody in dis shed is goin&#x2019; to get hurt...an&#x2019; it ain&#x2019;t me or Orman!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jonas, you gonna do somethin&#x2019;?&#x201d; asked Reed Exley. &#x201c;Or you just gonna sit here and let them animals kill your kids?&#x201d;<br><br>Jonas licked his lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to let Web see if he can talk them out. They like Web. Maybe he can do something with them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt it,&#x201d; snarled Exley. &#x201c;But so he talks &#x2018;em into lettin&#x2019; your kids loose and throwin&#x2019; their guns out. What you gonna do then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said Jonas. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just cross one bridge at a time here. Most important thing is to get Melissa and Darrel out of there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, they oughtta be hanged or shot through the head in front of the rest of your slaves,&#x201d; grunted Exley. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t make an example of &#x2018;em, the next time you whip one, you&#x2019;ll go through this kind of nonsense again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dexter!&#x201d; called Steele, unwilling to stretch the ordeal out any longer. &#x201c;Can we talk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;s listenin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br><br>Web Steele left his crouch and stood to his full height, exposing<br>his empty hands. The Hart brothers set admiring eyes on him from<br>their low position. Wealthy plantation owner Dudley Steele&#x2019;s handsome<br>son stood three inches over six feet, with a muscular frame. He<br>had thick, wavy black hair, matching well-trimmed mustache,<br>medium-length sideburns, and coal-black eyes.<br><br>As Web was about to speak, Mabel Hart&#x2019;s high-pitched voice<br>could be heard from the back porch of the mansion. &#x201c;Jonas! Do<br>something! They&#x2019;ll kill our children!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We are!&#x201d; Jonas shouted back. &#x201c;Just stay calm!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dexter!&#x201d; called Steele.<br><br>&#x201c;Yassuh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There is nothing to gain by doing harm to Melissa and Darrel. Let them come out, and we&#x2019;ll talk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cain&#x2019;t do that, Massa Web! If&#x2019;n we let the kids go, Massa Jonas will beat us again! &#x2019;Specially now that we done shot &#x2019;im. We ain&#x2019;t gonna have no mo&#x2019; of those beatin&#x2019;s! We ain&#x2019;t lazy like he say. We works hard. But we cain&#x2019;t keep up the kind o&#x2019; workin&#x2019; he&#x2019;s puttin&#x2019; on us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dat&#x2019;s right, Massa Web!&#x201d; came Orman&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;We knows about yo&#x2019; slaves. Ain&#x2019;t none o&#x2019; them gets treated like us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m sure if you&#x2019;ll let Mr. Hart&#x2019;s children loose, he&#x2019;ll not beat you. His wound is not serious. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll not punish you for it, and will be more tolerant from now on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We wants to hear him say dat!&#x201d; shouted Orman.<br><br>Steele looked down at Jonas Hart. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br><br>Jonas&#x2019;s face flushed and his eyes had fire in them. &#x201c;Web, I can&#x2019;t tell those two I&#x2019;ll be more tolerant! You can&#x2019;t expect me to just overlook this and tell them all is forgiven!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re going to have to if you don&#x2019;t want to get those<br>kids hurt...or killed,&#x201d; replied Steele.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with tellin&#x2019; &#x2019;em everything&#x2019;s all right so they&#x2019;ll let the kids go...then blast &#x2018;em when they show their faces?&#x201d; suggested Exley.<br><br>Web scowled at him. &#x201c;You fool, Reed! There are more than thirty men in that crowd of slaves standing out there watching us. If we shoot Dexter and Orman, they just might decide to swarm in here and tear us apart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We got two guns,&#x201d; parried Exley.<br><br>&#x201c;And how many bullets will you have after blasting Dexter and Orman?&#x201d; clipped Steele. &#x201c;Even if yo...</p><h2>Kai Lung&#39;s Golden Hours</h2><p>As with other Kai Lung novels, the main plot serves primarily as a vehicle for the presentation of the gem-like, aphorism-laden stories told by the protagonist Kai Lung, an itinerant story-teller of ancient China. In Kai Lung&#39;s Golden Hours he is brought before the court of the Mandarin Shan Tien on treasonable charges by the Mandarin&#39;s confidential agent Ming-shu. In a unique defense, Kai Lung recites his beguiling tales to the Mandarin, successfully postponing his conviction time after time until he is finally set free. In the process he attains the love and hand of the maiden Hwa-Mei.</p><p>Kai Lung&#39;s Golden Hours is presented here in a high quality paperback edition. This popular classic work by Ernest Bramah is in the English language, and may not include graphics or images from the original edition. If you enjoy the works of Ernest Bramah then we highly recommend this publication for your book collection.Kai Lung's Golden Hours is part of the Wildside Fantasy Classics series, which also includes: <p>The Well at World's End, by William Morris One of Cleopatra's Nights, by Theophile Gautier Fantastics and Other Fancies, by Lafcadio Hearn Some Chinese Ghosts, by Lafcadio Hearn The Phantom Ship, by Capt.

This edition, selected from over 140 volumes in German, is the new standard in English, and contains poetry, drama, fiction, memoir, criticism, and scientific writing by the man who is probably the most influential writer in the German language. The executive editors of this collection are Victor Lange of Princeton University, Eric Blackall of Cornell University, and Cyrus Hamlin of Yale University.</p><br><p>Princeton University Press is proud to be the distributor of the twelve volumes in hardcover of the originating publisher, Suhrkamp Verlag. In addition, Princeton will issue paperback reprints of these volumes over the next two years, beginning with volumes one through three.</p><br><p>Goethe, the founder of the poetry of experience, created a body of poetry that is unsurpassed in lucidity of speech and imagery and in instinct for melody and rhythm. Nonetheless, many of his poems are relatively unknown to English-speaking audiences, partly because of the difficulties they have posed to translators. This volume contains translations, side by side with the German originals, of Goethe's major poems--all prepared by eminent American and English writers, and all attesting to his poetic genius.</p><br><p>Goethe's most complex and profound work, Faust was the effort of the great poet's entire lifetime. Written over 60 years, it can be read as a document of Goethe's moral and artistic development. Faust is made available to the English reader in a completely new translation that communicates both its poetic variety and its many levels of tone. The language is present-day English, and Goethe's formal and rhythmic variety is reproduced in all its richness.</p><br><p>The reflections on art and literature that Goethe produced throughout his life are the premise and corollary of his work as poet, novelist, and man of science. This volume contains such important essays as "On Gothic Architecture," "On the <i>Laocoon</i> Group," and "Shakespeare: A Tribute." Several works in this collection appear for the first time unabridged and in fresh translations.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Marketing Playbook: Five Battle-Tested Plays for Capturing and Keeping the Lead in Any Market</h2><p><p>Every company needs to figure out the best way to beat the competition. What do you do if the other guy is already dominating the market? Should you challenge them head on or lie low for a while? Should you offer customers high-end features or a low-end price? Or both?</p> <p>During their years at Microsoft, John Zagula and Richard Tong answered such questions so effectively that they helped Microsoft Office and Windows grow from a 10 percent to 90 percent market share. As venture capitalists, Zagula and Tong have continued to test and perfect their system with hundreds of companies of all sizes and at all stages.</p> <p>Now they&#x2019;re sharing their best ideas and methods in an easy-to-apply book that will be enormously helpful to marketers in every industry and leaders in every size company.</p> <p><b>The Marketing Playbook</b> explains the five basic strategies for a competitive market&#x2014;The Drag Race Play, The Best of Both Play, The High-Low Play, The Platform Play, and The Stealth Play. It illustrates how each one works, how to pick the best one for a given situation, and then how to implement it effectively in the real world.</p> <p>Just like a great sports coach with a well-designed playbook, managers who read this book will have the tools, tips, and tricks they need to leapfrog market research, craft a smart strategy, motivate their team, and start scoring major points with customers and against the opposition.</p></p><p><p>John Zagula spent eight years at Microsoft, where he developed the Microsoft Office brand and marketed the desktop and server application product lines.</p> <br><p>Richard Tong worked at Microsoft for ten years, serving as VP of marketing and business development for Microsoft Windows, Office, and Back Office. Both are venture capitalists with Ignition Partners.</p><b>Introduction </b><p> What do a rural telecom service provider, a fifty-person call center, a high-end computer manufacturer, a three-PhDs-in-a-garage start-up, the world�s largest software company, and you all have in common?</p><p> Probably lots of things. But certainly one of the most surprising is that, for any given product and at any given time, each of them follows one of only five marketing strategies�or plays, as we like to call them�to win in their marketplace. Just five. Seriously.</p><p> Consciously or unwittingly, rightly or wrongly selected, well or poorly executed, these plays have been and are being used by companies as diverse as those above, each placing its bet on one of only five strategy alternatives to gain or defend its position in its market. And that includes you, whether you know it or not.</p><p> <i>The Marketing Playbook</i> has been over seventeen tough years in the making. Even before we knew we were following an actual system that could be articulated, we were continuously testing, retesting, and refining this book�s methods, tools, and guidelines in the rigors of the real marketplace.</p><p> The core concepts at the heart of this book were first forged in the furnace of Microsoft�s highly competitive market situations in the late 1980s and 1990s, when the two co-authors of this book were in the thick of the company�s crucial marketing efforts. Whether you�re facing large, entrenched competition, numerous smaller players, or an as yet undefined market landscape, finding the right path to market leadership is a hard thing to do. But across all these situations, through repeated trial and error, we found a common thread, a basic logic that lay behind all the moves that ultimately succeeded.</p><p> It wasn�t until we were asked to share our methods and techniques to help train other marketing and business folks that it actually dawned on us we were following a discrete, focused system.</p><p> When we sat down to plan out the lessons we wanted to share with other Microsoft businesspeople and reviewed all the strategies that we had in fact deployed across our various product launches, competitive battles, and customer targets, we were surprised to find that, no matter how hard we tried to come up with more, we discovered that in each case, one of only five basic approaches had provided the path to victory. And this was not because our imaginations were limited; it was because these five really covered all the situations we faced. These are the five plays, the heart of the Playbook system.</p><p> The people with whom we shared these plays were struck by their clarity and simplicity, and how well they fit every type of situation. Many were seasoned marketing and business professionals, but time and time again, they consistently found the plays one of the easiest ways to understand and effectively guide their own plans.</p><p> The five plays really seemed universally applicable. But maybe we were just biased by our experience; maybe these strategies would not apply beyond the scope of our current jobs. After all, very few companies have the market position or financial wherewithal of a Microsoft. And indeed, after we left Microsoft and started a venture capital firm, we found ourselves confronting a whole new set of challenges.</p><p> The companies we worked with boasted fewer resources, had less-tested products than their rivals, and often faced competitors much larger than themselves. Further, they were under the gun, knowing that one significant misstep and they could easily go under. So there wasn�t a lot of room for error. These companies needed to find a simple, reliable way to map out an effective marketing strategy that fit their unique goals and means. And it turned out that no matter what the company, product, or challenge they faced, one of the five plays worked for them, too.</p><p> All five are great plays. That said, it became clear that no matter what the play, if you�re running it on the wrong playing field or with the wrong resources, it just won�t work. Our experiences with small companies in different industries underscored how important it is to do your homework on these conditions before you bet your resources, reputation, and future on any given strategy. How well you do this homework can mean the difference between roaring success or auguring into the earth, fast.</p><p> And so, in addition to the five plays, we developed, tested, and applied a simple method for understanding your market and the conditions you face. This shorthand for plotting conditions as a map of your playing field has become a standard, both for how we as venture capitalists assess our investments and also for how our companies chart their course and choose their own play.</p><p> Finally, across all these companies and throughout our own careers, we have learned over and over that no matter how well you plan, execution is what ultimately determines the winner. Whatever your objective or strategy, you need a great, hard-hitting marketing and sales campaign to actually bring you across the goal line. And this is one of the hardest things in the world to pull off.</p><p> Through our work on multiple product launches of Microsoft Office, Windows, and related products, and in our work with portfolio and partner companies, we have accumulated a very tight set of skills, rules of thumb, and basic principles for pulling off great campaigns and ultimately capturing the lead position even in the most intense contests. These methods have also proven consistently easy to adopt and effective to apply no matter what the company, industry, or situation.</p><p> Another thing that this wide ranging set of companies and businesspeople we have worked with (and you) have in common is that they don�t have a lot of time to spend reading marketing or business strategy books. They�re too busy working their butts off trying to grab or hold on to the leadership slot in their market.</p><p> <b>Why We Wrote This Book</b><br><br> It�s because of the same group of businesspeople that we decided to write this book. These colleagues have repeatedly let us know that what they want is a more helpful, straightforward marketing guide than the hype, buzzwords, or academic theory they typically see. They told us that they would like to read a book that not only shows them how to gain and hold on to their rightful leadership position but also helps them repeat the process over and over, a book they could believe, a book whose methods and suggestions have been tested and proven in the heat of battle, a book written by people who knew from experience how to attain and retain the lead in a market but who also knew how to make the process easy to follow and implement.</p><p> And they told us that the method we had developed, tested, and shared with them really worked. They were convinced that others would benefit as well from reading and learning how to use this system.</p><p> In addition to our own accumulated experience, our interactions with these businesses and businesspeople have taught us huge, consistent, and enduring lessons. It is these lessons that we share with you here.</p><p> <i>The will to win is important, but the will to prepare is vital.</i><br> �JOE PATERNO, FOOTBALL COACH, PENN STATE<br><br> <b>1. Getting Started</b><br><br> What exactly is a �Marketing Playbook� and how do you use one?</p><p> Everyone thinks marketing is the fun and glamorous part of business, where you get to play around with creative stuff, brainstorm clever headlines, go to photo shoots, do press interviews, see yourself in print, and finally get a chance to toot your own horn. Marketing as imagination, art, and magic.</p><p> Sure, there is some of that. But marketing is deadly serious. Whether you�re a stodgy financial services firm or a whimsical children�s brand, winning companies with effective marketing derive even their most creative, off-the-wall efforts not simply from creative thinking but from sound strategy. Why?</p><p> Because winning matters�and it usually takes a strategy to win.</p><p> OK�so how do you go about deriving a winning strategy in a way that makes sense?</p><p> You can hire a consulting firm, spend man-months educating them about your business, and hope that, besides regurgitating a lot of what you told them, they might also give you some valuable input that justifies the expense.</p><p> You can have a bunch of off-sites with lots of brainstorming, soft drinks, junk food, and scribbling on whiteboards. But even with a strong agenda and a good moderator, too often nothing focused or actionable or tangible results.</p><p> Or you can take control of the process. In a very short timeframe, you can build a �Playbook� to guide your marketing decisions and actions�mostly using information you already know. Based on this homework, you can then choose which of five plays is appropriate to your situation, and then apply a set of straightforward guidelines for driving successful action that is practical and proven.</p><p> Fine. Sounds good. But, what exactly is this Playbook?</p><p> First of all, it is <i>your</i> Playbook. The Playbook isn�t <i>this</i> book. This book is just here to help you write and use your own Playbook�the version best suited for your needs. By this we don�t mean that your Playbook helps you craft a nicely worded strategy or do a better job managing those consultants or running those off-sites (though it does those things, too). We do mean that your Playbook is the essential guide you will create and keep at your side to help you win, to help you define, establish, and defend your desired position in your market� whatever that may be.</p><p> Your Playbook should be the tool you refer back to, to guide your actions and decisions and to motivate those of your team.</p><p> What does this Playbook consist of? It�s simple. Just three things:</p><p> First, your Playbook will identify one of five possible plays that you select as best fitting your situation and goals. (Sure, at this point it�s hard to imagine that just five plays could cover all business situations. But as you�ll discover for yourself in Part I of this book, five are all you need to have a full range of choices.)</p><p> Second, your Playbook will include a carefully thought-out map of your playing field that will allow you to execute your chosen play with confidence. This map will show where you want to get, what you�re up against, and what you actually have. You will create this map by reviewing your situation, goals, and challenges in a way that validates the play you have chosen and guides you to the right play for each step in your progress. That�s Part II of the book.</p><p> Finally, your Playbook will prepare you for the true test of strategy�the reality of running the play in action. It will arm you and your team with a set of simple guidelines to help you successfully run the play you have chosen and to best respond to the live action of the real market. That�s Part III.</p><p> For each of these three sections of your Playbook, we�ll arm you with a corresponding set of basic concepts or rules that you can turn to for making sure that you�re actually moving ahead in the most effective way.</p><p> The best part: it actually works, and in hours, not weeks.</p><p> Here�s a quick advance look at what you�ll be doing.</p><p> <b>Step 1. Your Strategy Options�The Five Marketing Plays</b><br><br> Before you place your bets, before you jump into action, you need to understand your options. You need to choose a strategy with the best chances of success. This basic marketing and competitive strategy is what we mean when we talk about your �play.�</p><p> One of our favorite examples of an effective play comes from the time when we were still at Microsoft.</p><p> The year was 1999, and one of the product groups was gearing up for the launch of Microsoft SQL Server, a terrific new database server product that was a key part of one of Microsoft�s most important growth businesses. At the time there was one dominant player in this high-end enterprise database server market: Oracle.</p><p> The Microsoft SQL team was all pumped up. They had delivered a great product, the first real contender for the space in a long time. They had also done their homework: they knew everything there was to know about the Oracle product, they had talked to lots of potential customers, and they knew their own product upside down and sideways.</p><p> When we first sat down together to map out the launch campaign, their plan was to attack Oracle head on.</p><p> And why not? Everybody at Microsoft�and a great many other people, as well�was sick and tired of Larry Ellison�s bombast. And we envied Oracle�s loud, hard-hitting, and exorbitant PR and advertising claims. So why <i>not</i> attack? We had a great new product, it cost a lot less than Oracle�s, we knew we were committed to supporting it, and we had the marketing dollars to do it. We were Microsoft, for Pete�s sake, we should be able to win.</p><p> The problem was, we were making some wrong assumptions. The straightforward, head-on play wasn�t appropriate. Even though our product was better in a lot of ways, Oracle still had us beat on a few key dimensions such as the ability to scale up to very big installations and highly complex jobs. Even though most users would rarely if ever need the capability, Oracle always beat its chest over that one issue. To be candid, our competition had us on this one; it was Oracle�s true position of strength. And it happened to be the area that a lot of large companies were paranoid about.</p><p> Oh, sure, they also cared about price, but not that much. Also, our Microsoft heritage and reputation didn�t really help us that much in this market. While everyone trusted that we built great, easy-to-use consumer software, we were far from being perceived as a truly �enterprise-class� provider, at least not for mission-critical applications. Oracle, on the other hand, had enjoyed that reputation for years.</p><p> So the smart play ended up not being the direct attack (a.k.a. a Drag Race Play, as you will see soon)�at least not at this stage. Instead, we decided to find the areas where Oracle�s biggest strength didn�t matter as much. Rather than attack Oracle directly and get compared on the criteria that it had already successfully established, we would have to use something more like a quarterback sneak (which we call a Stealth Play).</p><p> The campaign we settled on said in essence, �Go ahead, use Oracle. That�s fine in those instances that it�s really needed�but on jobs like X, Y, and Z, do you really need to spend so much money and lose so much flexibility?�</p><p> Stepping back and choosing the right play made all the difference. With this more humble approach, Microsoft SQL Server was able to gain a true foothold in the market. We reduced the barriers for initial trials and we got people to start using the product and experiencing its benefits. We focused on the targets for whom this made a lot of sense. And although the jury is still out, SQL Server sales have gone from zero to huge and market share from zero to a very significant percentage, in just three years.</p><p> Sounds good. But how do you actually pick the right play for your Playbook? Every situation is so different.</p><p> Don�t sweat it too much. It may seem hard to believe, but our experience with hundreds of businesses and their specif...</p></p><h2>Newton&#39;s Wake: A Space Opera</h2><p>With visionary epics like <i>The Stone Canal</i>, <i>The Cassini Division</i>, and <i>Cosmonaut Keep</i>, award-winning Scottish author Ken MacLeod has led a revolution in contemporary science fiction, blending cutting edge science and razor-sharp political insights with pure, over-the-top interstellar adventure. Now MacLeod takes this heady mix to a new level with a stunning new SF masterwork--<i>Newton's Wake</i>.<br><br>In the aftermath of the Hard Rapture--a cataclysmic war sparked by the explosive evolution of Earth's artificial intelligences into godlike beings--a few remnants of humanity managed to survive. Some even prospered.<br><br>Lucinda Carlyle, head of an ambitious clan of galactic entrepreneurs, had carved out a profitable niche for herself and her kin by taking control of the Skein, a chain of interplanetary star-gates left behind by the posthumans. But on a world called Eurydice, a remote planet at the farthest rim of the galaxy, Lucinda stumbled upon a forgotten relic of the past that could threaten her way of life.<br></p><p>Ken MacLeod holds a degree in zoology and has worked in the fields of biomechanics and computer programming. His first two novels, <i>The Star Fraction </i>and <i>The Stone Canal,</i> each won the Prometheus Award;<i> The Cassini Division</i> was a finalist for the Nebula Award; <i>The Sky Road </i>won the British Science Fiction Association Award, and it and <i>Cosmonaut Keep</i> were finalists for the Hugo Award. His novella <i>The Human Front</i> won the Sidewise Award. Ken MacLeod lives near Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and children.<br>CHAPTER 1<br>&nbsp;<br>Combat Archaeology<br>&nbsp;<br>As soon as she stepped through the gate Lucinda Carlyle knew the planet had been taken, and knew it would be worth taking back. It bore the thumbprints of hurried terraforming: bluish grass and moss, low shrubbery like heather. No animal life was visible, but she had no doubt it was there. Five kilometres away across an otherwise barren moor dotted with outcrops and bogs a kilometre-high diamond machine speared the sky. Complex in aspect, somewhere between a basaltic cliff and a cathedral, it had shown up on the robot probe, but that was nothing compared to actually looking at it.<br>She turned away from it and looked back at the gate. It was marked by a hilltop henge, whether by the gate's builders or by subsequent, less sophisticated minds she couldn't guess: two three-metre slabs upended, and topped by a third. One by one her team stepped forth from the unlikely shimmer and gazed around at the landscape. A yellow G5 sun blinked a bleary, watery morning eye over the horizon.<br>'Grim place,' said Macaulay, the ordnance fellow, as drizzle gusted. 'Minds me a Scotland.' He heaved a Charnley plasma cannon to his shoulder, mimed a shot at the distant edifice, and--abashed by Carlyle's sudden glare--looked to the robot walkers that carried the heavier gear.<br>'Divil you were ever in Scotland,' jeered Amelia Orr, comms op and Carlyle's great-great-grandmother, who had been.<br>'Shut it,' said Carlyle. She flinched slightly at her own words, but she was in charge here, and she had to stamp authority on seniority, and fast. She strongly suspected that Orr had been put on the team to keep an eye on her, and harboured contingency plans to take over if Carlyle faltered. On the inside of her helmet the names of the rest of the ten-person team lit up one by one. Meanwhile the suit's firewalls fenced with the atmosphere. The planet was habitable--inhabited, even, damn their cheek-- but its bacteria, viruses, and fungi all had to be neutralised. It would be an hour or more before the suits had passed on the new immunities to the team's bloodstreams, and the suits, or at least the helmets, could be dispensed with.<br>'Are you picking up anything?' she asked Orr, in a carefully polite tone.<br>The older woman tight-beamed a glyph of to Carlyle's headup. 'Usual encrypted chatter.' 'Some music. D'ye want to hear it?'<br>Carlyle raised a suit-gloved hand. 'No the now.' She swept the hand forward. 'Come on guys, this is gonna be a slog.'<br>It was.<br>Two hours later their suits were covered in mud and stained with bits of the local analogues of bracken, moss, and lichen, crawling with tiny tenlegged analogues of arthropods, and their firewalls were still running the virtual equivalent of fever, but they were all standing in front of the glittering cliffs. Carlyle let the team deploy a hundred metres away from the first visible ground-level gap and consulted her familiar. Professor Isaac Shlaim was an Israeli comp sci academic whose vicissitudes since the Hard Rapture could have filled a book, and had. So far Carlyle had resisted his entreaties to have it published.<br>'Whaddae ye make of it?' she asked.<br>The familiar's icon filled a quadrant of the head-up. The icon was a caricatured face that Lucinda varied whenever she felt too uncomfortably reminded that Shlaim had once been human.<br>'From after my time,' he said, a slightly smug tone overlying his usual mixture of resentment and resignation to his plight. 'Can you confirm that it is the only such artifact on the planet?'<br>'No.'<br>'May I access your remote sensing equipment?'<br>Carlyle hesitated. The familiar's efforts to escape the circuits of her suit were as predictable as they were persistent. On the other hand, she needed his assistance more than usual.<br>'I'll scan then gie ye a download,' she compromised.<br>'Excellent!' said Shlaim. Even centuries removed from muscle-tone and breath, his cheerful compliance sounded forced.<br>The radar and sonar pings and full-spectrum scan took about a minute and returned a mass of data quite incomprehensible to Carlyle, or to any individual human. She filed it, isolated it, and tipped it and a copy of Shlaim into a firewalled box. Let the poor bugger fight whatever demons might lurk in the electromagnetic echoes of the posthuman relic before them.<br>Macaulay was chivvying his iron gorillas into setting up the field pieces to triangulate the provisionally identified entrance. Orr was lying on her back surrounded by small dish aerials. The other team members were prone on the edge of a dip, periscope sights and plasma rifles poking over it, for whatever good that would do. From here the irregularities of the diamond cliff looked like crenellated battlements, its high black hollows like loopholes. But there was no evidence anywhere Carlyle could see of firing on the moor: no burn marks in the knotty ankle-high scrub, no glazed slag. The sense of being watched was overpowering, but she knew from experience that this meant nothing. She'd felt the same tension on the back of her neck in front of natural cliffs.<br>She ducked to stay beneath this nominal skyline and ran over to Jenny Stevenson, the biologist, who had one hand on her rifle and with the other was picking bits of grot off her suit and feeding them into an analyser.<br>'How's it looking?' Carlyle asked.<br>Stevenson's brown-eyed gaze flicked from her head-up to focus on Carlyle, and crinkled to show the top of a smile. Her grubby glove's thumb and forefinger formed an 'O.'<br>'Compatible,' she said. 'After we've got the immunities, we could turn they plants into food, nae bother.'<br>Carlyle flicked a finger at a clump of scrub, jangling its tiny violet bellshaped flowers. 'Is this really heather?'<br>'Naw really,' said Stevenson. Her smile brightened. 'Just an analogue, like. Somebody's done a real sweet job on this. Took some ae the native life and adapted it. Ye can still see bits ae the native sequences in the DNA, braided in wi the terrestrial stuff. Every cell here must be running two genetic codes simultaneously, which is quite a trick. I'm picking up signatures of they Darwin-Gosse machines fae way back, where was it?'<br>'Lalande 21185.'<br>'Aye, that's the one.'<br>'Good work,' said Carlyle. This was a puzzle; AO, the main population of terraformers, mistrusted Darwin-Gosse machines, but it was always possible that a deviant sect had bought some. 'That'll maybe gie's a handle on the squatters. Speaking of which.'<br>She rolled to Orr, staying outside the barrier of aerials. 'Have the locals spotted us yet?'<br>Orr remained staring upward, at some combination of the real sky and the images being patched in from her apparatus. She didn't turn around; probably still smarting.<br>'No's far as I see. Place is under satellite surveillance, sure, but I've no ta'en any pings. Most ae the action's round the other side of the planet, and all we're picking up here is spillover. I got a few quantum demons grinding through the encryption. Should be cracked in an hour or so.'<br>'Any low orbit presence?'<br>Orr waved a dismissive hand skyward. 'Scores of satellites. Sizes range between a grape and a grapefruit. No exactly heavy industry. Typical fucking farmers.'<br>'Any deep space stuff?'<br>'Aye, a few, but it's hard to tell fae leakage ae tight-beam transmissions. The odd asteroid miner, I reckon. Maybe a fort or two.'<br>Carlyle chewed a lip, sucked hot coffee from her helmet nipple. 'Makes sense. The squatters don't seem to be AO, whoever they are.'<br>Orr sniggered. 'Squatters coulda picked a better place to fittle into. Makes me wonder why they didnae fittle straight back out.'<br>'Yeah,' said Carlyle. 'Well, assuming.' Assuming a lot about the squatters' tech level and motivations, was what she meant. She sat up, hunkered forward, elbows on knees, looking around. 'When your demons have finished we might have something to go on. Meanwhile...' She toggled to an open circuit. 'Time for a bit ae combat archaeology.'<br>The mission profile was straightforward. They were neither to hide from nor confront the squatters, but instead pull down from the busy sky as much information as they could about them, then scout the diamond machine-mountain for any traces of usable tech and/or dangerous haunts, and get the hell out before sunset. Her familiar had found no signals in the noise bounced back from the precipitous face, but as Carlyle stalked forward alone, the Webster reaction pistol strapped to her hip, her backup team behind her to keep her covered, she felt her knees tremble. It wasn't so much the possible soul-searing dangers presented by the incomprehensible posthuman artifact, as it was a fear of screwing up. This was her first big job for the firm, one she'd fought hard to get, and she had no intention of blowing it. And on the plus side of the ledger, there was always the chance that the tech in here would be radical and capable of being parlayed into wealth beyond the dreams, etc. There was always that, but it wasn't enough. It wasn't what kept you walking forward, like a soldier into enemy fire. The Carlyles led from the front, always had, from the days when the worst any of them faced was a chibbing in a Glasgow close.<br>From a few metres away she saw that the lower part of the face, to about head height, was overgrown with moss and grass, evidently on the slow stacking of windblown dust. Above that the slope was sheer, the surface so smooth that nothing could gain purchase. The gap, a triangle ten metres high and three across at the base, had been dark only from a distance, and by contrast. As she walked into the cleft Carlyle could see that the interior was almost as bright as the outside. The passage itself was only a few paces long.<br>The ground level of the space opened out before her. It was so like a forest of frost-rimed low trees that for a moment she wondered if it was indeed that, perhaps a region of the heath trapped under this machine and preserved. A closer look at the nearest of the objects showed her that there was nothing biological there: the clear crystalline structure was replicated on an increasing scale from the frost that covered the needles through to the needles themselves, and the branches, to the main stem that sprouted out of the floor.<br>The floor was like ice, its transparency diminishing with depth. Looking up, Carlyle saw that the entire interior of the machine was encrusted with similar tree-like structures, the ones above hanging down like enormous chandeliers, their prismatic bevelled sides shining with every colour of the visible spectrum in the sunlight that slanted through the outer surface.<br>'It's diamond all right,' said Shlaim.<br>'How much <i>carbon</i> is locked up in this?' Carlyle asked.<br>'Many millions of tons,' said the familiar. 'An entire coal measure, I would say, save that coal measures seem unlikely here.'<br>'Or an entire carbonaceous chondrite? Could they have done that?'<br>'If so it would be a quite profligate use of anti-gravity.' Shlaim sounded skeptical. 'Or they could have lowered it from a skyhook, I suppose, but it would seem pointless...'<br>Carlyle laughed. 'Since when has <i>that</i> ever ruled out anything they did?'<br>'In any case,' said Shlaim, 'it appears to have been grown or manufactured in situ. From atmospheric carbon, like a plant.'<br>'It's no just carbon,' Carlyle said.<br>'Indeed not.'<br>Looking down the aisle between rows of diamond shrubbery Carlyle could see other, metallic colours interrupting the riotous monotony of the prisms. The frequency and size of these interruptions increased towards the centre of the artifact, where an arrangement of copper and steel, conical in outline, complicated in detail, rose a hundred metres or more from the floor. The grail in this cathedral, or the host. It looked more like a machine than the rest of the structure did, its hints of organic form echoing animal rather than plant structures.<br>She walked along to the nearest apparently metal object. About a metre and a half high, it seemed a miniature of the thing in the centre. Squatting beside it, she peered at the intricate surface. Fluted, mirror-smooth steel, veined with copper that could have been tubing, in a series of varied but individually precise diameters. In among the copper were other lines, green and red, that resembled and might even be plastic insulation around wires. Checking her head-up, Carlyle saw that this object was slightly above the ambient temperature of the artifact. She switched to IR and looked again at the central cone. It too glowed, more strongly than its smaller counterparts.<br>'Something going on here,' she said. 'Some kinda circulation. Flow of electricity, maybe fuel.'<br>She reached a hand towards it.<br>'Don't touch it!' warned Shlaim.<br>'Course not,' said Carlye. 'Just waving the inductance--'<br>'I would still caution against--'<br>Something fizzed and melted on the object's surface. A jolt of heat or electricity jackknifed Carlyle's arm back.<br>'Shit!' She wanted to suck her fingertips. She jumped up and backed off, clutching her numb elbow. The thing was moving, flowing as though melting into the floor. It spread, and long tendrils that looked like dribbles of mercury reached the bases of a few of the diamond bushes. These too began to move, branches clicking into new and different shapes like a multitool with nanchuk blades, the trunks becoming dislodged from nowrevealed grooves in the floor as they did so. Carlyle backed off farther, and drew the Webster. Within seconds the metal object had become the central component of a frightening arachnoid array of skittering legs and waving arms, the whole freestanding and rotating as though deciding where to pounce. She could see <i>lenses</i>, formed through some complex infolding of prisms, and they were scanning her.<br>'I think at this point there is nothing to lose by firing,' said Shlaim, with irritating calm.<br>The Webster roared and bucked in her hands. The machine leapt backwards several metres but was otherwise unaffected. Projectiles ricocheted for what seemed a long time. Before the sounds tinkled to a halt Carlyle turned to sprint for the opening. All around her, machines were assembling themselves. She fired as she ran, hitting the metal cores here and there with effect before the diamond carapaces could form around them. Liquid bled and burned.<br>Out of the opening she sprinted as far and as she could, then threw herself forward and rolled.<br>'Fire at will!' she shouted.<br>A Charnley bolt singed the air a metre above her. There was a flash. Then a cacophonous sound from her radio speakers deafened her. Something shorted in her helmet, stinging her neck. She rolled farther, over the lip of ground. The team were all blazing away at the opening. The banshee outcry ceased. Carlyle slammed another clip in the Webster and fired at the gap in the wall. The robot walkers were rocking back and forth on their spring-loaded legs as they lobbed shells from their field pieces, to no effect Carlyle could see apart from chewing up the soil around the face of the edifice. The diamond walls hadn't taken a scratch.<br>'Cease fire!'<br>The shooting ran down to a ragged patter then stopped. Carlyle lay prone and peered at the hole as the smoke cleared. One of the multi-legged machines stood there, not moving forward or back. It had, she was pleased to see, taken some damage. Not much.<br>She was momentarily blinded as a laser beam from the machine slashed a line of fire across the ground a couple of metres forward of their position.<br>'Hold it!' she yelled.<br>Nothing further happened.<br>'Looks like we've been warned off,' she said heavily. 'Time to pull out. We can come back wi' a search engine.'<br>They picked up their gear and retraced their steps towards the gate.<br>'No a bad recce,' said Orr.<br>'Thanks,' C...</p><h2>I, Fatty</h2><p><p>In this highly acclaimed novel, the author of Permanent Midnight channels fallen early-Hollywood star Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.

Song accompanied the farmer&#x2019;s labors, calmed the herder&#x2019;s flock, and set in motion the spinner&#x2019;s wheel. Today this tradition continues. Music blares on the shop floor; song accompanies transactions in the retail store; the radio keeps the trucker going on the long-distance haul.<p></p><p>Now Ted Gioia, author of several acclaimed books on the history of jazz, tells the story of work songs from prehistoric times to the present. Vocation by vocation, Gioia focuses attention on the rhythms and melodies that have attended tasks such as the cultivation of crops, the raising and lowering of sails, the swinging of hammers, the felling of trees. In an engaging, conversational writing style, he synthesizes a breathtaking amount of material, not only from songbooks and recordings but also from travel literature, historical accounts, slave narratives, folklore, labor union writings, and more. He draws on all of these to describe how workers in societies around the world have used music to increase efficiency, measure time, relay commands, maintain focus, and alleviate drudgery. </p><p>At the same time, Gioia emphasizes how work songs often soar beyond utilitarian functions. The heart-wringing laments of the prison chain gang, the sailor&#x2019;s shanties, the lumberjack&#x2019;s ballads, the field hollers and corn-shucking songs of the American South, the pearl-diving songs of the Persian Gulf, the rich <i>mbube</i> a cappella singing of South African miners: Who can listen to these and other songs borne of toil and hard labor without feeling their sweep and power? Ultimately, <i>Work Songs</i>, like its companion volume <i>Healing Songs</i>, is an impassioned tribute to the extraordinary capacity of music to enter into day-to-day lives, to address humanity&#x2019;s deepest concerns and most heartfelt needs.</p></p><p>&#34;Ted Gioia enriches and makes real the powerful message that music is, and has always been, an integral part of the toolkit that ordinary humans have used to navigate life. He shows that, far from being a pastime to fill idle moments or a distraction from everyday preoccupations, music addresses fundamental issues of human existence, survival, and liberation. Gioia&#39;s work offers hope to those who fear that the corporate mass media may have suffocated the age-old impulse of ordinary people to make music their own.&#34;--John Sloboda, author of &#34;Exploring the Musical Mind&#34;<p>Ted Gioia, pianist, composer, and one of the founders of Stanford University&#x2019;s Jazz Studies program, is the author of Healing Songs, also published by Duke University Press, as well as several celebrated books, including <i>West Coast Jazz: Modern Jazz in California, 1945&#x2013;1960</i>.

On the French liner home, he meets two Chinese beauties, Miss Su and Miss Pao. Qian writes, "With Miss Pao it wasn't a matter of heart or soul. She hadn't any change of heart, since she didn't have a heart."

(<i>The New York Review of Books</i>, Pankaj Mishra)</p><h2>Demoniality: Incubi and Succubi</h2><p><p>This 17th century treatise on demonology, written by the respected theologian, Catholic priest, and exorcist, Rev. Father Sinistrari, examines a particular class of spirits known as the incubus and succubus. These minor demons crave sex and often attack their victims while they sleep. Though incubus and succubus are considered less dangerous than possessing demons, they can be relentless in pursuit of their desire and grow violent when resisted.</p><p>Demoniality advances novel theories about occult biology, claiming demons can reanimate corpses to have sex and impregnate victims with demonic seed to produce offspring who are "tall, hardy, bold and wicked." An expert on witchcraft and sexual sin, Rev. Father Sinistrari included sections on related phenomena, including: bestiality, necrophilia, demonic pacts, witchcraft, witches' marks, devil worship and magical beings such as fauns, centaurs and elves.</p><p>Father Sinistrari was a learned Franciscan Friar who used deductive reasoning to examine the characteristics of the spirit world. For example, do demons have mass? He concludes they do, but determines they are porous--allowing for their supernatural feats of passing through objects and appearing from nowhere. He also classified the demonic spirits by their actions, explaining that some seek out corrupt pacts with witches or wizards, while others are parasitic and indiscriminately attack the innocent.</p><p>As a primer on demonic behavior, Demonality is extremely detailed. Father Sinistrari was schooled in the sciences of the time, including herbalism, alchemy, elements, humors and the symptoms of witchcraft--even serving as an advisor to the notorious Inquisition. Because of this, he focuses on diagnoses and remedies to expel the pests, using his alchemical knowledge to devise herbal formulas for countering a demon's specific elemental nature. These elaborate herbal recipes are similar to the elixirs found in a magician's grimoire or a witch's book of shadows.</p><p>The title of the book is a play on the word bestiality, which conveys Father Sinistrari's belief that copulating with demons is, similarly, a sinful act and a crime. But while incubus and succubus are spirits doing evil deeds, Father Sinistrari is not dismissive of their salvation. He advances the theological argument that these minor demons have souls, and can be saved from damnation. He distinguishes them from the more vulgar type that tend to possess humans in terrifying displays. As proof, he shows how this latter class of demon greatly fears religious relics, while incubus and succubus do not object when in their presence: clear evidence, according to Sinistrari, that they are not damned, but are likely in limbo.</p><p>As a prominent exorcist of his time, Father Sinistrari encountered victims of demonic activity on a regular basis. Many of the afflicted were, ironically, nuns and priests in the service of God or people under their care. In one story, a young maiden of noble birth is romantically pursued by a spirit that, out of frustration with her chastity, finally attacks her. Another story involves a nun who disappeared to her cell where two voices are heard along with groaning and the creaking of her bed. A rival nun drilled a hole through the partition to see an attractive young man lying with her sister who mysteriously disappeared when the two were confronted.</p><p>References to demonic attack were carved into stone four thousand years ago, long before Jesus Christ, the greatest exorcist of them all, walked the earth. As Christianity took hold, encounters with these entities were often laid out in moral terms. Father Sinistrari took a different approach: applying reason to understand this curious phenomenon along with theology, history and science. The result is this interesting treatise.</p></p><p>Ludovico Maria Sinistrari was born in Ameno, Italy on February 26th, 1622 and died in 1701 at the age of 79. A Roman Catholic priest, theologian and prominent exorcist of his time, Rev. Father Sinistrari wrote a number of influential books on demonology and served as an advisor to the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition. After studying in Pavia, he entered the Franciscan Order in 1647 and eventually taught philosophy and theology. He achieved notoriety with his books, which delved into the intricate details of copulation with demonic forces and every type of sexual sin. As an exorcist, he postulated that demons were corporeal and were able to reproduce with human beings. He also claimed that demons had souls that could be saved. As an exorcist, he was often exposed to demonic possession and related first hand accounts of exorcisms. A trained academic and herbalist, he often experimented with formulas of herbs in conjunction with elements and bodily humors, to counter demonic activity. Rev. Father Sinistrari was notable for his attempts to use deductive reasoning, scripture, mythology and his knowledge of the natural world, in order to cure the demonic phenomena plaguing his community.</p><h2>The Starlight Crystal</h2><p>Joining the crew of the spaceship <i>Traveler </i>in order to study Earth for two centuries, Paige Christian survives a terrible tragedy that befalls the planet and her fellow crew members.</p><p>It is two hundred years in the future and 18 year old Paige Christian has been given a chance to join the crew of the Traveler, a special spaceship designed to circle the solar system at near light speed.

He has also written three books of short stories, four collections of essays and two books of non-fiction, Nothing to be Frightened Of and the Sunday Times number one bestseller Levels of Life. In 2017 he was awarded the Legion d&#39;honneur.I don't believe in God, but I miss Him. That's what I say when the question is put. I asked my brother, who has taught philosophy at Oxford, Geneva, and the Sorbonne, what he thought of such a statement, without revealing that it was my own. He replied with a single word: "Soppy."<br><br>The person to begin with is my maternal grandmother, Nellie Louisa Scoltock, nee Machin. She was a teacher in Shropshire until she married my grandfather, Bert Scoltock. Not Bertram, not Albert, just Bert: so christened, so called, so cremated. He was a headmaster with a certain mechanical dash to him: a motorcycle-and-sidecar man, then owner of a Lanchester, then, in retirement, driver of a rather pompously sporty Triumph Roadster, with a three-person bench seat in front, and two bucket seats when the top was down. By the time I knew them, my grandparents had come south to be near their only child. Grandma went to the Women's Institute; she pickled and bottled; she plucked and roasted the chickens and geese that Grandpa raised. She was petite, outwardly unopinionated, and had the thickened knuckles of old age; she needed soap to get her wedding ring off. Their wardrobe was full of home-knitted cardigans, Grandpa's tending to feature more masculine cable stitch. They had regular appointments with the chiropodist, and were of that generation advised by dentists to have all their teeth out in one go. This was a normal rite of passage then: from being rickety-gnashered to fully porcelained in one leap, to all that buccal sliding and clacking, to social embarrassment and the foaming glass on the bedside table.<br><br>The change from teeth to dentures struck my brother and me as both grave and ribald. But my grandmother's life had contained another enormous change, never alluded to in her presence. Nellie Louisa Machin, daughter of a labourer in a chemical works, had been brought up a Methodist; while the Scoltocks were Church of England. At some point in her young adulthood, my grandmother had suddenly lost her faith and, in the smooth narration of family lore, found a replacement: socialism. I have no idea how strong her religious faith had been, or what her family's politics were; all I know is that she once stood for the local council as a socialist and was defeated. By the time I knew her, in the 1950s, she had progressed to being a communist. She must have been one of the few old-age pensioners in suburban Buckinghamshire who took the <i>Daily Worker</i> and--so my brother and I insisted to one another--fiddled the housekeeping to send donations to the newspaper's Fighting Fund.<br><br>In the late 1950s, the Sino-Soviet Schism took place, and com-munists worldwide were obliged to choose between Moscow and Peking. For most of the European faithful, this was not a difficult decision; nor was it for the <i>Daily Worker</i>, which received funding as well as directives from Moscow. My grandmother, who had never been abroad in her life, who lived in genteel bungalowdom, decided for undisclosed reasons to throw in her lot with the Chinese. I welcomed this mysterious decision with blunt selfinterest, since her <i>Worker</i> was now supplemented by <i>China Reconstructs</i>, a heretical magazine posted direct from the distant continent. Grandma would save me the stamps from the biscuity envelopes. These tended to celebrate industrial achievement--bridges, hydroelectric dams, lorries rolling off production lines--or else show various breeds of dove in peaceful flight.<br><br>My brother did not compete for such offerings, because some years previously there had been a Stamp-Collecting Schism in our home. He had decided to specialize in the British Empire. I, to assert my difference, announced that I would therefore specialize in a category which I named, with what seemed like logic to me, Rest of the World. It was defined solely in terms of what my brother didn't collect. I can no longer remember if this move was aggressive, defensive, or merely pragmatic. All I know is that it led to some occasionally baffling exchanges in the school stamp club among philatelists only recently out of short trousers. "So, Barnesy, what do you collect?" "Rest of the World."<br><br>My grandfather was a Brylcreem man, and the antimacassar on his Parker Knoll armchair--a high-backed number with wings for him to snooze against--was not merely decorative. His hair had whitened sooner than Grandma's; he had a clipped, military moustache, a metal-stemmed pipe, and a tobacco pouch which distended his cardigan pocket. He also wore a chunky hearing aid, another aspect of the adult world--or rather, the world on the farther side of adulthood--which my brother and I liked to mock. "Beg pardon?" we would shout satirically at one another, cupping hands to ears. Both of us used to look forward to the prized moment when our grandmother's stomach would rumble loudly enough for Grandpa to be roused from his deafness into the enquiry, "Telephone, Ma?" An embarrassed grunt later, they would go back to their newspapers. Grandpa, in his male armchair, deaf aid occasionally whistling and pipe making a hubble-bubble noise as he sucked on it, would shake his head over the <i>Daily Express</i>, which described to him a world where truth and justice were constantly imperilled by the Communist Threat. In her softer, female armchair--in the red corner--Grandma would tut-tut away over the <i>Daily Worker</i>, which described to her a world where truth and justice, in their updated versions, were constantly imperilled by Capitalism and Imperialism.<br><br>Grandpa, by this time, had reduced his religious observance to watching <i>Songs of Praise</i> on television. He did woodwork and gardened; he grew his own tobacco and dried it in the garage loft, where he also stored dahlia tubers and old copies of the <i>Daily Express</i> bound with hairy string. He favoured my brother, taught him how to sharpen a chisel, and left him his chest of carpentry tools. I can't remember him teaching (or leaving) me anything, though I was once allowed to watch while he killed a chicken in his garden shed. He took the bird under his arm, stroked it into calmness, then laid its neck on a green metal wringing machine screwed to the doorjamb. As he brought the handle down, he gripped the bird's body ever more tightly against its final convulsions.<br><br>My brother was allowed not just to watch, but also to participate. Several times he got to pull the lever while Grandpa held the bird. But our memories of the slaughter in the shed diverge into incompatibility. For me, the machine merely wrung the chicken's neck; for him, it was a junior guillotine. "I have a clear picture of a small basket underneath the blade. I have a (less clear) picture of the head dropping, some (not much) blood, Grandpa putting the headless bird on the ground, its running around for a few moments . . ." Is my memory sanitized, or his infected by films about the French Revolution? In either case, Grandpa introduced my brother to death--and its messiness--better than he did me. "Do you remember how Grandpa killed the geese before Christmas?" (I do not.) "He used to chase the destined goose round its pen, flailing at it with a crowbar. When he finally got it, he would, for good measure, lay it on the ground, put the crowbar across its neck, and tug on its head."<br><br>My brother remembers a ritual--never witnessed by me--which he called the Reading of the Diaries. Grandma and Grandpa each kept separate diaries, and of an evening would sometimes entertain themselves by reading out loud to one another what they had recorded on that very week several years previously. The entries were apparently of considerable banality but frequent disagreement. Grandpa: "Friday. Worked in garden. Planted potatoes." Grandma: "Nonsense. 'Rained all day. Too wet to work in garden.'"<br><br>My brother also remembers that once, when he was very small, he went into Grandpa's garden and pulled up all the onions. Grandpa beat him until he howled, then turned uncharacteristically white, confessed everything to our mother, and swore he would never again raise his hand to a child. Actually, my brother doesn't remember any of this--neither the onions, nor the beating. He was just told the story repeatedly by our mother. And indeed, were he to remember it, he might well be wary. As a philosopher, he believes that memories are often false, "so much so that, on the Cartesian principle of the rotten apple, none is to be trusted unless it has some external support." I am more trusting, or self-deluding, so shall continue as if all my memories are true.<br><br>Our mother was christened Kathleen Mabel. She hated the Mabel, and complained about it to Grandpa, whose explanation was that he "had once known a very nice girl called Mabel." I have no idea about the progress or regress of her religious beliefs, though I own her prayer book, bound together with <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i> in soft brown suede, each volume signed in surprising green ink with her name and the date: "Dec: 25th. 1932." I admire her punctuation: two full stops and a colon, with the stop beneath the "th" placed exactly between the two letters. You don't get punctuation like that nowadays.<br><br>In my childhood, the three unmentionable subjects were the traditional ones: religion, politics, and sex. By the time my mother and I came to discuss these matters--the first two, that is, the third being permanently off the agenda--she was "true blue" in politics, as I would guess she always had been. As for religion, she told me firmly that she didn't want "any of that mumbo-jumbo" at her funeral. So when the undertaker asked if I wanted the "religious symbols" removed from the crematorium wall, I told him I thought that this is what she would have wanted.<br><br>The past conditional, by the way, is a tense of which my brother is highly suspicious. Waiting for the funeral to start, we had, not an argument--this would have been against all family tradition--but an exchange wh...</p><h2>Ultimate Geography and Timeline Guide 2nd Edition</h2><p>From selecting appropriate reference materials, to constructing a timeline, to establishing a student notebook, this book will guide you through literature, science, and history, and includes a complete multi-level geography course for middle and high school students, with reproducible outline maps.

In <i>Fatal Politics,</i> Hughes turns to the final years of the war and Nixon&#x2019;s reelection bid of 1972 to expose the president&#x2019;s darkest secret.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While Nixon publicly promised to keep American troops in Vietnam only until the South Vietnamese could take their place, he privately agreed with his top military, diplomatic, and intelligence advisers that Saigon could never survive without American boots on the ground. Afraid that a preelection fall of Saigon would scuttle his chances for a second term, Nixon put his reelection above the lives of American soldiers. Postponing the inevitable, he kept America in the war into the fourth year of his presidency. At the same time, Nixon negotiated a "decent interval" deal with the Communists to put a face-saving year or two between his final withdrawal and Saigon&#x2019;s collapse. If they waited that long, Nixon secretly assured North Vietnam&#x2019;s chief sponsors in Moscow and Beijing, the North could conquer the South without any fear that the United States would intervene to save it. The humiliating defeat that haunts Americans to this day was built into Nixon&#x2019;s exit strategy. Worse, the myth that Nixon was winning the war before Congress "tied his hands" has led policy makers to adapt tactics from America&#x2019;s final years in Vietnam to the twenty-first-century conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, prolonging both wars without winning either.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Forty years after the fall of Saigon, and drawing on more than a decade spent studying Nixon&#x2019;s secretly recorded Oval Office tapes--the most comprehensive, accurate, and illuminating record of any presidency in history, much of it never transcribed until now-- <i>Fatal Politics</i> tells a story of political manipulation and betrayal that will change how Americans remember Vietnam. <i>Fatal Politics</i> is also available as a special e-book that allows the reader to move seamlessly from the book to transcripts and audio files of these historic conversations.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Ken Hughes, researcher at the University of Virginia&#x2019;s Miller Center Presidential Recordings Program, is the author of <i>Chasing Shadows: The Nixon Tapes, the Chennault Affair, and the Origins of Watergate</i> (Virginia).

It's 1964 in Alabama, and Jessie's African American family prepares to leave the South for better jobs and schools. Jessie knows that the best opportunities lie further north, but she doesn't want to leave her beloved grandparents and familiar home: "I wish my toes were roots. / I'd grow into a pin oak and never go away." Then moving day arrives, and the family piles into the station wagon for a long drive to Nebraska. In subtle, cadenced poetry, Harrington brings close the stark realities blacks faced in the segregated South ("Can't stop anywhere. / Only the Negro stations, / only the Negro stores") as well as Jessie's growing excitement as she considers what's ahead: "listening to the tires / make a road-drum, a road-beat: / good luck / good luck / good luck." Lagarrigue's paintings beautifully capture the family scenes in the car and the endless, shifting landscape from the window in soft-edged, thickly brushed strokes that heighten the emotions in Jesse's words--the nostalgia, the worry, and the bittersweet hope about a promising new place. Pair this with Jacqueline Woodson's <i>Coming on Home Soon</i> [BKL Ag 04], another quiet, powerful portrait of an African American child's view of family migration. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yet, just as in the case in <i>Tuesdays with Morrie</i>, this collection of plainspoken reflections transcends the "death and dying" category and is more aptly shelved in one's inspiration and spirituality collection. </p><p> For example, Schwartz's simple thoughts on courage could speak to any seeker of enlightenment. </p><blockquote> "Dealing bravely with physical pain or accidents takes one kind of courage," he writes. "Facing life as it is and accepting it requires another....I have found courage through seeking thoughtfulness, openheartedness, detachment, and other responses that make up a composed life and a calm response to illness....I hope that I can continue in this way to the end so that I die with inner peace. </blockquote> As it was, on November 4, 1995, Morrie Schwartz died just as he hoped he would. <p> In 1999, Walker &amp; Company decided to reissue <i>Letting Go</i> under a new title, <i>Morrie: in His Own Words</i> <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>In Morrie's memory, Walker will contribute a portion of every copy sold of <i>Morrie In His Own Words</i> to the Morrie S.

Ehrlich is a prizewinning writer with grants from the NEA and the Guggenheim Foundation, and she knows her way around the wide-open spaces of <i>The Horse Whisperer</i>, Nicholas Evans's adventure-romance about a maimed girl, her wounded horse, her horrible New York fast-track mother, and the mystical horseman who helps everybody heal and attain higher consciousness. By deciding to direct and star in the film from the book, Redford helped make it the most successful unpublished novel in history: it earned $8.15 million while still being written. He did not stint in hiring a writer to do this movie tie-in book. Ehrlich, who spent 17 years working on sheep and cattle ranches, poured into this assignment some of the authentic western flavor of her nonfiction books <i>The Solace of Open Spaces</i> and <i>A Match to the Heart: One Woman's Story of Being Struck by Lightning</i>. Here, Ehrlich puts Redford's horseman character in his proper context.

But mere activity and material results are not sufficient for a successful apostolate. In his classic work The Soul of the Apostolate, Dom Chautard demonstrates that the very foundation of all apostolic work must be the Interior Life. The apostle of Christ will grow to become an instrument and true channel of God&#39;s graces to the world only through prayer, meditation and the cultivation of the Interior Life. When one is involved in works of spiritual or corporal charity, his work can only be truly efficacious when he anchors his Interior Life in Christ. Without Christ we can do nothing.

Buffalo Bill, was the most famous American of his age. A child of the frontier Great Plains, Cody was renowned as a Pony Express rider, prospector, trapper, Civil War soldier, professional buffalo hunter, Indian fighter, cavalry scout, horseman, dime-novel hero, and actor. But Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s greatest success was as impresario of the Wild West show, the traveling company of cowboys, Indians, Mexican vaqueros, and others, numbering in the hundreds, with which he toured North America and Europe for more than three decades. As Louis S. Warren reveals, the show company came to represent America itself, its dazzling mix of races sprung from a frontier past, welded into a thrilling performance, and making their way through the world via the modern technologies of railroad, portable electrical generator, telephones, and brilliantly colored publicity&#x2013;an entrancing vision of the frontier-born, newly mechanized, polyglot United States in the Gilded Age.<br><br>Biographers have long disputed whether Cody was a hero or a charlatan. As Warren shows, the question already preoccupied critics and spectators during Cody&#x2019;s own lifetime. In fact, the savvy entertainer encouraged the dispute by mingling fictional exploits with his not inconsiderable achievements to construct the persona of an ideal frontiersman, a figure who was more controversial than has been commonly understood. At the same time, his show provided a means for rural westerners, including cowboys, cowgirls, and especially Lakota Sioux Indians, to claim a new future for themselves by reenacting a version of the past.<br><br>The most comprehensive critical biography of William Cody in more than forty years, <i>Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s America</i> places America&#x2019;s most renowned showman in the context of his cultural worlds in the Far West, in the East, and in Europe. A rich and revealing biography and social history of an American cultural icon.</p><p>Louis S. Warren is W. Turrentine Jackson Professor of Western U.S. History at the University of California, Davis. He is the author of<i> The Hunter&#x2019;s Game: Poachers and Conservationists in Twentieth-Century America,</i> which won the Western Heritage Award for Outstanding Nonfiction Book, 1998, awarded by the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center.<b> Pony Express<br></b><br> The Former Pony Post rider will show how the Letters and Telegrams of the Republic were distributed across the immense Continent previous to the railways and the telegraph.<br><br> Like every other frontier reenactment in the Wild West show, the Pony Express was a chapter in the life of its hero and his country. Before audiences of thousands, the horseman-not Cody himself, but another "Former Pony Post" rider-raced "down to the grand stand at a gallop," wrote one ecstatic viewer, "checked his pony within a length, and almost before it was at standstill the rider was on the ground, the bag on another pony, and the man galloping off at full speed, in less time than it would taken an ordinary man to dismount." It was a showstopper.<br><br> Of course Buffalo Bill rode the Pony Express. Everyone who perused the sixty or so printed pages of Wild West show programs could read it for themselves. "William F. Cody was born in Scott County, Iowa. He removed at an early age to Kansas, and was employed as a herder, wagonmaster, and pony express rider."<br><br> The more curious might buy a copy of Buffalo Bill's autobiography, also for sale at the Wild West show. There they could read the story in detail. Left fatherless at an early age, eleven, the young Kansas boy ventured out to make money for his bereaved mother, five sisters, and infant brother. Between his eleventh birthday, in 1857, and his fifteenth, in 1861, he freighted wagons over the plains with rough teamsters, befriended Wild Bill Hickok, was captured by enemy Mormons in the government's abortive war against polygamy, survived a starvation winter at Fort Bridger, skirmished with some Indians and befriended others, prospected for gold in Colorado, and trapped beaver on the Plains.<br><br> But of all the boyhood adventures William Cody claimed, those on the Pony Express were the most astonishing, and the most famous. On his way back to Kansas after failing to find gold at Pikes Peak, the thirteen-year-old boy ambled into the Pony Express station at Julesberg, Colorado, where he talked his way into his first Pony Express job. His mother feared it would kill him. "She was right about this, as fifteen miles an hour on horseback would, in a short time, shake any man 'all to pieces'; and there were but very few, if any, riders who could stand it for a great length of time." But young Will Cody took up his forty-five-mile route, and "stuck to it for two months," before he returned to Kansas to be with his mother, who had fallen ill.<br><br> After she recovered, the boy and a friend tried their hand at trapping beaver up the remote reaches of the Republican River, in western Kansas. They lost an ox, and so were unable to move their wagon when Cody slipped on the ice and broke his leg. Left behind while his friend went for a replacement ox team, the young boy spent a month alone, and avoided being killed by a Sioux war party only because its leader, Chief Rain-in-the-Face, remembered meeting the young Will Cody at Fort Laramie the previous year.<br><br> The following summer, in 1860, when he was fourteen, Cody returned to Pony Express riding again, and his adventures made his previous escapades seem pale in comparison. Warned that "it will soon shake the life out of you," he took up the most dangerous length of the Pony Express route, the Sweetwater Division. This section was under the supervision of John Slade, a notorious killer, but Cody recalled the man as civil, even kind, in his autobiography.<br><br> "My boy, you are too young for a pony-express rider. It takes men for that business."<br><br> "I rode two months last year on Bill Trotter's division, sir, and filled the bill then; and I think I am better able to ride now," said I.<br><br> "What! are you the boy that was riding there, and was called the youngest rider on the road?"<br><br> "I am the same boy," I replied, confident that everything was now all right for me.<br><br> The boy proved himself more than equal to the man-size job. Arriving at the end of his seventy-six-mile stretch of road one day, he discovered that the rider to whom he was to pass the specially designed saddlebag, or mochila, had been killed in a drunken brawl the night before. Cody "did not hesitate for a moment to undertake an extra ride of eighty-five miles to Rocky Ridge," where he arrived on time. "I then turned and rode to Red Buttes, my starting place, accomplishing on the round trip a distance of 322 miles," which would go down in history as one of the longest Pony Express rides ever.<br><br> Shortly afterward, he outran an Indian attack, making a twenty-four-mile run on one horse. Not much later, the Indians attacked a company stagecoach between Split Rock and Three Crossings, and managers suspended the pony service. During this lull, the young Cody set out with his friend Wild Bill Hickok and a group of forty men "who had undergone all kinds of hardships and braved every danger" to pursue the Indians and recover stolen horses. They found the Indian encampment up the Powder River, raided it, and returned "with all of our own horses and about one hundred captured Indian ponies."<br><br> Ever since 1879, when William Cody first published his life story, this childhood saga has been a favorite of the American public. The Wild West show reprised it over and over again, the high-speed Pony Express scene in Buffalo Bill's Wild West inscribing an almost indelible bond between young America and the child Will Cody. The pony was featured in the show's debut in 1883, and audiences from Omaha to New York, Sarasota to Paris, thrilled to the display every year thereafter until the show ended in 1916.<br><br> Cody's boyhood story of horseback days, of a boy who enters a man's world too early, was a familiar one in some respects. Young Will, the story's hero, is the victim of bad circumstances, but raises himself up through hard work, ambition, and good luck, meeting powerful men such as Chief Rain-in-the-Face, Wild Bill Hickok, and John Slade, who patronize his efforts. Like a western version of Horatio Alger's Ragged Dick, which had first appeared twelve years earlier, Cody's life story was an exhortation to the sons of the middle class. It inspired faith in the stage star, Buffalo Bill Cody, as a genuine western figure and a respectable, middle-class icon for the urban middle classes who were its intended audience. It extolled family, hard work, and willingness to take risks-all virtues of the middle-class family in the industrial age. "Mr. Cody tells his story in a simple, unaffected style that commands belief," wrote one reviewer, "and it is about as full of incident and adventure as its pages will allow." The book was respectable, too, not like dime novels which corrupted the nation's youth with romantic tales of theft and bloodshed. The reviewer doubted that "the perusal of the book will lure a single boy to run away from school, steal a revolver and tramp to the border, for somehow the men who know what frontier life really is always give the impression that there is a great deal of downright hard work about the borderer's life."<br><br> What if you wanted to know more about those Pony Express adventures? The problem was there was not much to read on the subject other than Buffalo Bill's autobiography and show programs. The freighting firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell created the Pony Express to carry mail between Saint Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, in 1860. The service was wildly popular, especially in California, where it was memorialized in heroic tributes even as it began.<br><br> But it lasted only eighteen months. When it ended, in 1861, the Civil War had erupted. The epic clash of North and South at Shiloh, Gettysburg, and the Wilderness absorbed the energies of almost every American historian for the next three decades. Few attempted unpacking the West until the 1880s. Nobody wrote a book-length history of the Pony Express until after 1900.<br><br> In the meantime, Buffalo Bill's Wild West show became the primary keeper of the pony legend. By the 1890s, when William Lightfoot Visscher began gathering material for his history of the Pony Express, the business records of Russell, Majors, and Waddell had long since vanished, and Buffalo Bill's Wild West show had been promoting William Cody's version of the pony's history for the better part of two decades. Cody was the world's most renowned showman and westerner, and had made himself far and away the most famous rider of the legendary pony line. He was also a personal friend of Visscher's. When the journalist's Thrilling and Truthful History of the Pony Express appeared in 1908, it was less history than hagiography, a devotional recounting of the heroic lives of saints. The author repeated Cody's stories without any criticism.<br><br> Since then, every scholarly history of the Pony Express has mentioned Buffalo Bill's adventures. Every generation of Americans has thrilled to them in a succession of children's books and movies which have retold his Pony Express days as wholesome, outdoor, familial inspiration to American youth. To this day, William F. Cody's stature as the most famous Pony Express rider of them all remains largely unchallenged.<br><br> Only the most devoted reader knows about the doubters. Some who knew Cody said he was lying even in the 1880s. A few historians mention in footnotes or even in the text of their books that his stories are impossible to verify. A tiny minority have suggested he made the whole thing up.<br><br> Against these whispers, Cody biographers advance the standard of the trustworthy guide. The most famous of these, Don Russell, long ago concluded that Buffalo Bill mostly told the truth. Cody's account is full of genuine figures from the Pony Express, and he pinpoints locations of Indian battles with descriptions that are often accurate. How could he have known so much if he was not there? Besides, William Cody won the Medal of Honor for Indian fighting in 1872. He was already a wealthy man and a stage star when he put the story in his autobiography in 1879. He had no reason to lie.<br><br> How much of the story was true? The search for answers is illuminating in two ways. On the one hand, it may lead us to matters of fact, about what really happened to the boy William Cody. On the other hand, poring over Cody's stories, true and false, can point the way to deeper truths. A man lies to mislead. But, as any detective can tell you, the most deceptive liar reveals a great deal about himself through his choice of untruths. Lies cover the teller's tracks, but they also betray how he thinks. The line between truth and fiction in William Cody's childhood story is less a boundary marker between the serious and the trivial than a pathway to a deeper understanding of the man and his age.<br><br> What we know of Cody's childhood comes largely from two sources: his own autobiography, which he published in 1879, when he was already a theatrical star, and the memoirs of his elder sister, Julia, which she didn't pen till the early 1900s. The veracity of his autobiography is a constant source of debate. Written in Rochester, New York, during his off-season from the theater, it was a long press release meant to enhance his already formidable star qualities. Cody shaped his life story to meet public expectations and desires. Every single one of the book's claims must be treated with care.<br><br> The question of its authorship endures. A coterie of press agents and dime novelists churned out revised editions of the Cody autobiography periodically through 1920. During the same period, dozens of ghostwritten dime novels appeared under Buffalo Bill's authorship. Many critics have lumped Cody's 1879 autobiography with the novels, as the hokum of some advance man or another. But if the pages of some later editions are purple with hack writers' clich�s, the prose in this first edition of his life story is markedly restrained (as reviewers noted at the time). Moreover, it is full of what we know to be Cody's own phrasing and tone. It contains a great deal of truth that only Cody knew. If he did not write it, he dictated it. For all its many fictions, it stands as Buffalo Bill Cody's own story of his life from childhood to the age of thirty-three.<br><br> Julia Cody's memoirs offer some correctives to her brother's fantasies, but she was understandably reluctant to contradict him. In many cases, neither sibling was entirely truthful. Reading these two accounts against one another, and weighing them against the handful of other evidence we can muster, we begin to discern real events of his childhood under the quilting of fiction which covered them.<br><br> William Cody, hero of the Indian wars, did outrun murderous enemies as a boy. But they were not Indians. He did carry messages, but not the U.S. mail. He had his first taste of combat as a very young man, but when he first sighted down a rifle barrel at a man, it was likely not at any Sioux or Cheyenne. The West of the boy William Cody was riven by war on families, in which homes burned, and families were threatened, scattered, or worse. War defined his life from the time he was eight until he was about thirty. And in war he learned, above all else, the vulnerability of family and home.<br><br> William Frederick Cody was born near Leclaire, Iowa, on February 26, 1846. His father, Isaac Cody, had been born in Canada and at the age of seventeen had settled in Ohio with his parents and siblings. He was already a widower when he met and married Mary Laycock in Cincinnati in 1840. Soon after, the couple, with Isaac's daughter from an earlier marriage, Martha, moved to Iowa in search of new opportunities. William Cody was the third child of Isaac and Mary, having been preceded by a brother, Sam, in 1841, and a sister, Julia, in 1843. By 1853, there were seven children at home, including the two brothers and a total of five sisters: Martha, Julia, Eliza Alice, Laura Ella (often called Helen), and Mary Hannah, called May. In Iowa, Isaac Cody managed large farms for absentee owners, and ran a stage business between Davenport and Chicago. The children recalled their father as a traveling man who returned home between trips ferrying passengers across the wide prairie. Sometimes the young Codys stood on the riverbank, watching as Isaac's brightly colored wagon passed by on its way to or from Chicago. The constant search for new opportunities led Isaac to consider joining the gold rush to California. He changed his mind when he heard tales of woe from returning emigrants and was unable to finance the trip. Instead, he and Mary Cody settled on a move to Kansas Territory. Their decision may have been motivated in part by the death of their eldest son, Sam, crushed beneath a bucking mare in 1853, at the age of twelve.</p><h2>Thai Boxing Dynamite: The Explosive Art Of Muay Thai</h2><p>You&#39;re in the ring when three flashing kicks from the Muay Thai boxer knock you to the canvas.

Howard's memorable villain finally gets an origin story of his own in this volume, which collects a four-issue miniseries of the same name. Thoth is a beggar "in the blighted city of Memphia," his morals slowly eroded by an abusive father and harsh life on the streets. When his friend Amon receives an invitation to apprentice in the house of the kindly priest of Ibis, Thoth kills Amon and takes his place in the priest's home. Busiek (<i>Astro City</i>, <i>JLA/Avengers</i>) and the legendary Wein (<i>Swamp Thing</i>) do a fine job telescoping a lifetime's worth of sinister plotting and backstabbing into relatively few pages. Narration is well-executed and evocative ("a new wind did waft through Memphia, thin and dry though it was") and the narrator's identity, revealed at the end, is a nice twist. There is much blood shed in the book, but most of it is implied; only a few scenes contain graphic violence, although virtually every page bears at least one image that is genuinely terrifying or haunting. Liberal use of shadows and wiry outlines in Kelley's solid but moody art give shape to a world where even the agents of light do not seem entirely trustworthy. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Devised by Fritz Kahn (1888&#x2013;1968), a German-Jewish physician and popular science writer, &#x201c;Der Mensch als Industriepalast&#x201d; (or &#x201c;Man as Industrial Palace&#x201d;) achieved international fame and was reprinted, in various languages and versions, all over the world. It was a new kind of image&#x2014;an illustration that was conceptual and scientific, a visual explanation of how things work&#x2014;and Kahn built a career of this new genre. In collaboration with a stable of artists (only some of whom were credited), Kahn created thousands of images that were metaphorical, allusive, and self-consciously modern, using an eclectic grab-bag of schools and styles: Dada, Art Deco, photomontage, Art Nouveau, Bauhaus functionalism, and commercial illustration.&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>Body Modern</i>, Michael Sappol offers the first in-depth critical study of Fritz Kahn and his visual rhetoric. Kahn was an impresario of the modern who catered to readers who were hungry for products and concepts that could help them acquire and perform an overdetermined &#x201c;modern&#x201d; identity. He and his artists created playful new visual tropes and genres that used striking metaphors to scientifically explain the &#x201c;life of Man.&#x201d; This rich and largely obscure corpus of images was a technology of the self that naturalized the modern and its technologies by situating them inside the human body.</p><p>The scope of Kahn&#x2019;s project was vast&#x2014;entirely new kinds of visual explanation&#x2014;and so was his influence. Today, his legacy can be seen in textbooks, magazines, posters, public health pamphlets, educational websites, and Hollywood movies. But, Sappol concludes, Kahn&#x2019;s illustrations also pose profound and unsettling epistemological questions about the construction and performance of the self. Lavishly illustrated with more than 100 images, <i>Body Modern</i> imaginatively explores the relationship between conceptual image, image production, and embodied experience.</p></p><p><p>Michael Sappol is fellow at the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in Uppsala. He is the author of <i>A Traffic of Dead Bodies: Anatomy and Embodied Social Identity in Nineteenth-Century America</i> and <i>Dream Anatomy</i>, and the editor of <i>A Cultural History of the Human Body in the Age of Empire</i> and <i>Hidden Treasure: The National Library of Medicine</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>"The chance meeting of <i>Popular Mechanics</i> and <i>Gray&#x2019;s Anatomy</i> on a dissecting table, Fritz Kahn&#x2019;s cutaway views of our inner workings expose far more than blood, guts, and bones. Taking Kahn&#x2019;s delirious illustrations as his jumping-off point, Michael Sappol uses his vast historical erudition, just enough theory, and a prose style that cuts like a knife to lay bare the visual unconscious of the Machine Age. Delving deeper, he discovers the self, a cognitive widget turned out by Modernism&#x2019;s philosophical assembly line.

"The experience is one that neither he nor young readers will ever regret or forget." (<i>Booklist,</i> starred review). Our new <i>Pictureback�</i> format provides simple text written by the author.</p><p>Raymond Briggs was born in London in 1934.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 15, he&nbsp;&nbsp;went to Wimbeldon Art School to learn how to draw, as he wanted to become a cartoonist.&nbsp;&nbsp;But there he was told that cartooning was not a profession for gentlemen and that he ought to be a painter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond then went on to the Slade School in London to study painting as a full-time student.&nbsp;&nbsp;During his spare time, he began work on a portfolio of illustrations of all kinds, including jackets and a wide selection of drawings to take to publishers.&nbsp;&nbsp;After illustrating for advertising, newspapers and books, Raymond discovered that book illustration inspired him the most, since it offered far greater variety and freedom than anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;Raymond has always found it unfavorable to sustain a consistent illustration style for a long period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is always seeking to try something else new and different with his work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of Raymond's best known works are <b><i> The Snowman </i></b>, <b><i> The Man </i></b>, and <b><i> The Bear </i></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting for <b><i> The Snowman </i></b>is based on Raymond's own house and garden, which is in Sussex, England at the foot of South Downs, a few miles from Brighton.PreSchool-K-- For some reason, Briggs has added words to his immortal wordless picture book about a small boy's nocturnal adventures with an all-too-mortal snowman. The result, to say the least, is disappointing. It features fewer pictures described in simple declarative sentences that relate the action but lose the potency of the narrative. Further, the story has been trimmed, and incidents adding texture to the original have been lost. Much of the snowman's characterization is gone; his gentle meeting with a cat has been cut, as have his telling fear of a lighted stove, his wonderment at the TV, and his bemusement at a pair of false teeth. All of his slapstick adventures with James's toys are gone; half of the flying journey has been eliminated. The bittersweet ending remains as Briggs allows James to make his discovery of his melted friend without comment, but much of its resonance is missing with the lost pictures. What is left is a simple, rather ordinary story of an adventure with a flying snowman suitable for preschoolers who might well have waited a bit longer until they were old enough to enjoy James's magical interlude in its fullest glory. --Christine Behrmann, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Daily Orthodox Prayer Book</h2><p>Everyday prayers for Orthodox Christians contains the vital prayers for a daily prayer rule in the Orthodox life.

Designed to help sewers of all skill levels, the pages of <i>Threads</i> provide the right tools to create functional and fashionable clothing to last a lifetime. Must-have patterns, essential techniques, and expert advice are available at www.threads.com</p>Since 1983 Threads magazine has examined the many forms of sewn work by offering its readers practical how-to directions, and this book collects 29 of these from the magazine. Refreshingly, the author of each seeks to create a ``personal'' textile, often breaking away from traditional patchwork. One creates each of her quilt patterns by painting a picture, then taking scissors to her canvas. Another uses a computer as an automated sketch pad to generate surprising quilt blocks, settings and colorations. A third designs over an unconventional grid (65, say, instead of 60 or 90), producing ``blocks'' with jagged edges that interlock to produce a surface full of movement and mystery Unusually flamboyant embroidery characterizes the crazy quilts featured. Another author describes the liberating effect of using the sewing machine with its feed dog disengaged: you can stitch line drawings by moving the fabric around. The unique cultural traditions of the Amish, Seminole Indians, Hawaiians and African Americans are shown to be related; making a Japanese-style futon is presented as a weekend project. Suggestions for using pieced work in clothing are offered. Altogether, this is a stimulating book for anyone who has made a few quilts.

She is a former Denver bureau chief for <i>Business Week </i>magazine and lives in Denver, Colorado.CHAPTER 1<br>&nbsp;<br>SOMETHING CAUSED MEN TO STARE at Nealie Bent, although just what it was that made them do so wasn&#x2019;t clear. Her body was more angles than curves, and her face, too, had all those sharp planes, far too many to be pretty. She was too tall to suit, and with her long legs, she took strides that were more like a man&#x2019;s than the mincing steps of a young girl. The dress she wore, one of only two she owned, was faded yellow calico, threadbare at the wrists and neck and of the wrong color to complement her pale skin. Her second dress was no better.<br><br>Still, men turned to look at Nealie Bent, for there was no question that the tall, thin girl was striking, or at least peculiar-looking, with her eyes the color of the palest blue columbines late in the spring, her hair such a pale red that it was almost the hue of pink quartz, and her face as freckled as a turkey egg. It could have been her youth that drew their attention. After all, Georgetown itself was still young, and youth was highly prized. Most of the young women there were already old, worn out from the work a mining town demanded of them and from childbearing. The Alvarado Cemetery was full of babies, with here and there a mother buried beside her newborn in that forlorn spot. Like all the mountain towns, Georgetown was a hard place, and folks there had a saying: Any cat with a tail is a stranger.<br><br>The same might be said in a slightly different way for a young woman, because any female with youth, such as Nealie, was new in Georgetown. But she would age quick enough. Still, for now&#x2014;and for a few years hence, perhaps&#x2014;the girl&#x2019;s youthfulness matched the spirit of the town, a place that was mightily attractive to those seeking to make their fortunes.<br><br>If it wasn&#x2019;t Nealie&#x2019;s youth that drew glances, then it might have been her air of innocence, and innocence was in even shorter supply in Georgetown than youth. But in that, the girl&#x2019;s appearance was a sham, for Nealie&#x2019;s short life had been a hard one. Though she knew more about the dark side of life than most her age, there was not even the hint of those hardships on Nealie Bent, and she appeared as fresh and guileless as a newborn.<br><br>So no one could put a finger on exactly what it was that made men take another look at Nealie, not that anyone in that town bothered to analyze. But no one doubted that they turned to stare at her as she passed them on the broad board sidewalk or paused in her rounds of shopping to peer into store windows at the delectable items she could only dream about buying.<br><br>Will Spaulding was no different from the rest of the men in his admiration. He&#x2019;d seen the girl as she filled her basket from the bins of apples and onions and potatoes. And now, as Nealie stood at the counter of the Kaiser Mercantile store, talking quietly with Mr. Kaiser, Will measured her with his eyes. She was five feet eight inches, only two inches shorter than he was. Will&#x2019;s eyes wandered over Nealie, taking in her slender build under the shabby dress, until he became aware that Mr. Kaiser was watching him and clearing his throat.<br><br>&#x201c;I said, &#x2018;What can I do for you, young man?&#x2019;&#x201d; the storekeeper repeated. The girl had placed her purchases in her basket and was turning to go, not sending so much as a glance at the man standing next to her.<br><br>Will cleared his throat, but he didn&#x2019;t speak immediately. Instead, he stared at the girl as she left the store and walked past the large glass window, leaving behind her soapy scent and the tinkling of the bell that announced customers. &#x201c;Who is she?&#x201d; he asked, as if he had the right to know.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s Nealie Bent,&#x201d; the older man replied, a look of bemused tolerance on his face. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not the first to ask. Did you come in for something or just to stare at the ladies?&#x201d;<br><br>Without answering, Will turned away from the door and looked at the shopkeeper. He removed a list from his pocket, laying it on the counter and smoothing it with his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m working up at the Rose of Sharon, and I&#x2019;ll be needing these things.&#x201d; He turned the list so that Mr. Kaiser could read it.<br><br>&#x201c;We take cash,&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser said, which wasn&#x2019;t exactly true. He extended credit to those in town who needed it, as well as to good customers such as Nealie&#x2019;s employer, but he did not extend the courtesy to strangers.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay it.&#x201d; Will&#x2019;s voice sounded as if he was not used to his credit being questioned. The older man moved his finger down the list, tapping a broken nail beside each item as he pronounced it out loud: &#x201c;Three pair work pants, three work shirts, cap, boots, jacket, gloves, candlesticks, candles.&#x201d; He droned on, and when he was finished, he said, &#x201c;Yep, you work at a mine, all right. You a trammer?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Engineer. For the summer.&#x201d;<br><br>The young man&#x2019;s voice carried the slightest bit of authority as he corrected the misimpression, and Mr. Kaiser looked up and squinted at him, taking in the cut of his clothes, which made it obvious that Will was too fashionably dressed to be an ordinary miner. &#x201c;You somebody&#x2019;s son?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Will appeared taken aback at the impertinence, but he replied pleasantly enough, &#x201c;Grandson. I&#x2019;m William Spaulding. My grandfather&#x2019;s Theodore Spaulding. He owns half of the Sharon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Owns mines up in Leadville and Summit County, too,&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser added. Like everyone in the mountain towns, the shopkeeper was caught up in the mining fever and was as sure of the names of prominent investors as he was of those of his own customers. And well he might be, because outside capital was the lifeblood of the mining industry. Without development money, the gold and silver deposits were all but useless. Theodore Spaulding was not only a man of wealth but one respected in mining circles for his understanding of ore bodies and extraction methods. That did not make his grandson anything more than a trifler, however. &#x201c;So you thought you&#x2019;d see what goes on underground, did you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already seen what&#x2019;s underground. I have an engineering degree, so I know about mining, you see, at least theoretically. The old man thought I ought to get some practical experience for the summer. I&#x2019;ve only just arrived.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get it.&#x201d; Now that he seemed satisfied about his customer&#x2019;s identity, Mr. Kaiser returned to the list. &#x201c;I reckon we got everything you need.&#x201d; He moved around behind the counter, taking down boxes and holding out shirts and pants for sizes. He told Will to try on the heavy leather cap, then nodded, because the fit was right. Then he handed the young man two pairs of boots and told him to see which ones suited. Will sat down on a kitchen chair propped against the cold potbellied stove and removed his fine shoes. He clumped about on the floor in the stiff boots, and settled on one pair.

You&#x2019;ll need plenty of them, because the Sharon floods, and you don&#x2019;t want to get your feet wet. Worst thing there is, wet feet in a mine. If the water doesn&#x2019;t rot your feet, it&#x2019;ll give you pneumonia.&#x201d; Mr. Kaiser placed four pairs on top of the pile of clothing.

It will look grand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not for looks, Mr. Spaulding. You&#x2019;ll need the handkerchief to wipe your face when it&#x2019;s slashed with muck and cover your mouth and nose after a dynamite blast so&#x2019;s you won&#x2019;t get the miner&#x2019;s puff.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then I thank you, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Kaiser licked the tip of the lead pencil he kept behind his ear and wrote the charge next to each item on the list, totaled the amount, and turned the paper toward Will, who pulled the money out of his pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s one other thing I&#x2019;m needing,&#x201d; the young man said, as he watched Mr. Kaiser wrap the purchases in brown paper and tie the bundle with string. &#x201c;A boardinghouse. I&#x2019;m staying at the Hotel de Paris until my cottage is ready. Once I move in, I&#x2019;ll need a place to eat, because I don&#x2019;t fancy cooking for myself.

The bosses prefer it, since it&#x2019;s a good bit tonier than the others. Ma Judson&#x2019;s place is up on Main. She sets a good table. Then there&#x2019;s Lydia Travers&#x2019;s house on Rose Street. If I was you&#x2019;d, I&#x2019;d board with Mrs. Travers&#x2014;Lidie, she&#x2019;s called.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the best cook?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d;<br><br>Will waited.<br><br>&#x201c;Fact is, when it comes to cooking, Mrs. Travers&#x2019;s second to Ma Judson and not much better than the Grubstake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cleaner, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not so&#x2019;s you&#x2019;d notice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why should I take my meals there?&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Kaiser studied the young man a minute and chuckled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where Nealie Bent works.&#x201d;<br><br>Will reddened, and the shopkeeper added, &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t be the first to pick Mrs. Travers&#x2019;s place because of Nealie.

Thank you for visiting - Edward Labate, National Chess Master!</p><p>Irving Chernev was born on January 29, 1900 in Pryluky in the Ukraine. He emigrated to the United States in 1920. He wrote some of the most successful and widely read chess books ever written. Contrary to popular belief and to the publicity blurbs on the chess books he wrote, Chernev was not an especially strong player. According to those I know who played him, his real strength was not more than Expert, although he did play in the 1942 US Championship. However, he was a lively and entertaining writer. On a percentage basis compared with the number of books he wrote, he is probably the most popular writer ever on the game of chess in history. His books are not read for the deep analysis but rather for the unusual games and chess positions, the curious facts and the amusing stories which have become part of chess lore that every chess player in the world now knows even those who have not read his books. He wrote that he &#34;probably read more about chess, and played over more games than any man in history.&#34; He wrote 20 chess books, among them: Chessboard Magic!; The Bright Side of Chess; The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played; 1000 Best Short Games of Chess; Practical Chess Endings; Combinations: The Heart of Chess; and Capablanca&#39;s Best Chess Endings. In 1945, he and Kenneth Harkness wrote An Invitation to Chess. Perhaps his most famous book is Logical Chess: Move by Move. Irving Chernev died in San Francisco, California on September 29, 1981.</p><h2>Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost</h2><p>This investigation into modern disasters in the Soviet Union, including the deaths of cosmonauts, industrial accidents, and major health crises, reveals why they were covered up and how they became known to the West</p><p>Among the Soviet disasters covered here are munitions-plant explosions, subway fires, anthrax contamination and nuclear-reactor meltdowns. The survey is wide-ranging; material on civilian airline crashes, for instance, makes it clear that air-safety standards in Russia are low. Oberg (Red Star in Orbit) explores the Soviet government's deep-rooted insistence on secrecy, showing that in the matter of technological safety precautions crucial information has been withheld from the West: he demonstrates that certain accidents that have occurred in the Soviet Union have been needlessly repeated in the West because preventive measures have not been shared. Oberg is cautiously hopeful about the effect of glasnost on the exchange of technological information: "Once (and if) this trend matures, we can settle down to the serious business of learning from each other's mistakes as well as from our own." Photos. Author tour. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Oberg, an aerospace engineer and observer of USSR space and military activities, has written an eye-opening expose of about 250 Soviet disasters. Treated in surprising detail, given the secrecy of Russian governments, they include events on land (hotel fires, nuclear accidents), in the air (civilian and military crashes), at sea (ship rammings, nuclear sub disasters), and in outer space. The usual Soviet response has been silence and denial, even at the expense of lives. Oberg's many sources included Soviet emigres, slips of Soviet tongues and pens, and CIA reports. Without gloating, Oberg gives us a glimpse of the limits of Soviet technology. Highly recommended.

Once the device is restored, it becomes clear this is not just a computer, but a thinking, reasoning artificial intelligence. <br> <br> It identifies itself as SecondGen White-Blue, and it comes from a civilization composed entirely of sentient computers. Eons ago these artificial intelligences were charged to be the first line of defense against The Null -- a destructive force so all-consuming that generation upon generation have waged unending war trying to find a way to beat back this terror. Captain Riker offers to assist them, but years of war have left the AIs distrustful and suspicious, especially of organics. <br> <br> The tide of the battle is turning, and The Null is winning.

They were financially successful bootleggers during the Great Depression and after Prohibition was repealed they put the Detroit River behind them and settled in Bonita Springs, Florida. The brothers had visited this hamlet as younger mean and had long been students of the wildlife of the Everglades and the regional wilderness. In the late 1930s they opened the Bonita Springs Reptile Gardens that evolved into Everglades Wonder Gardens, and which by the 1950s became Florida&#39;s premier wildlife attraction. The Piper brothers owned and exhibited the world&#39;s largest collection of threatened American crocodiles, and also pioneered captive propagation of the endangered Florida panther. They, and their animals, like &#39;Old Slewfoot&#39; of The Yearling, were featured in major motion pictures. Their Wonder Gardens educated tens of thousands of Americans in the early days of environmental education and eco-tourism. Their mission was clearly stated in their own words, &#39;We have only a sincere desire to give the visitor a clear picture of the thrilling life, dangers, intrigue and constant struggle for existence that goes on in the depths of the impenetrable and fascinating Everglades.&#39; The Piper brothers were undeniably the Wildlife Barons of the Everglades.</p><p>Charles has written a salty account about the lives of two legendary brothers, my father Bill, and my uncle Lester Piper. This biography weaves personal anecdotes and historical facts, and the outcome is an exciting and interesting biography about the lives of these two tough entrepreneurs, that led to the development of their wonderful Everglades Wonder Gardens. --Anna Piper Mackereth, Fort Myers, Florida<br><br>LeBuff gives us interesting insights into a landmark of Bonita Springs and perhaps its most fascinating family. Bill and Lester Piper's roadside attraction helped put Bonita Springs on the map and continues to attract people from around the world. --Charles Strader, former President of the Bonita Springs Historical Society<br><br>Lester and Bill Piper were two of the most interesting people I have ever known.

Why do people feel compelled to act out their tangled psychodramas on the national stage, and why do we so enjoy watching them? The motifs are classic� revenge, betrayal, ambition, madness� though the pitfalls are ones we all negotiate daily. After all, every one of us is a potential scandal in the making: failed self-knowledge and colossal self-deception� the necessary ingredients� are our collective plight. <i>How to Become a Scandal </i>is � an extremely smart, funny, acid, and beautifully written meditation on a scary truth that we all try desperately to ignore� (David Shields, author of <i>Reality Hunger: A Manifesto</i>).</p></p><p><b>Product Description</b><br> We all relish a good scandal&#x2014;the larger the figure (governor, judge) and more shocking the particulars (diapers, cigars)&#x2014;the better. But why do people feel compelled to act out their tangled psychodramas on the national stage, and why do we so enjoy watching them, hurling our condemnations while savoring every lurid detail? <p></p> <p>With "pointed daggers of prose" (<i>The New Yorker</i>), Laura Kipnis examines contemporary downfall sagas to lay bare the American psyche: what we desire, what we punish, and what we disavow. She delivers virtuoso analyses of four paradigmatic cases: a lovelorn astronaut, an unhinged judge, a venomous whistleblower, and an over-imaginative memoirist. The motifs are classic&#x2014;revenge, betrayal, ambition, madness&#x2014;though the pitfalls are ones we all negotiate daily. After all, every one of us is a potential scandal in the making: failed self-knowledge and colossal self-deception&#x2014;the necessary ingredients&#x2014;are our collective plight. In <i>How to Become a Scandal</i>, bad behavior is the entry point for a brilliant cultural romp as well as an anti-civics lesson. "Shove your rules," says scandal, and no doubt every upright citizen, deep within, cheers the transgression&#x2014;as long as it's someone else's head on the block.</p> <b>Amazon Exclusive: Tina Brown, Editor-in-Chief of <i>The Daily Beast</i>, Reviews <i>How to Become a Scandal</i></b> <br> <p> A brilliant curtain-raiser on exactly why it&#x2019;s so delicious to watch self-destruction, <i>How to Become a Scandal</i> is a must-read for anyone unable to look away from another&#x2019;s fall from grace. Laura Kipnis argues that it takes two to make a scandal and cuts through the tangled relationship between the scandalized victims and us as the voyeurs, noting that the audience is equally to blame for whipping up such frenzy. A thoughtful and juicy take on familiar targets (Linda Tripp and the NASA love triangle among them), Kipnis sees what we all do: some scandals are just thinly veiled self-sabotage. And the best stories aren&#x2019;t self-contained; they&#x2019;re far-reaching, full-blooded dramas, complete with a cast of characters who overtake the global stage. Of course, scandal&#x2019;s an all-inclusive monster, but a bigger star and more disturbing details make for an even better flameout. Kipnis astutely points out that the ceremonial shunning of whistleblowers, plagiarists, and cheaters is cathartic and neatly packages something amorphous: why America jumps on the wagon all over again each time someone violates social mores with lust and betrayal and jealousy. Reading her clever book is like sitting in a front-row seat at Scandal Theory 101&#x2014;and serves as a cautionary tale for those tiptoeing on the edges of indignity. Revisiting the denouements of James Frey, Sol Wachtler et al is a strangely elegant exercise in how to crash, burn, and ultimately survive. <i>How to Become a Scandal</i> is as transfixing and engrossing as the tremendously chaotic tales she recounts with exacting detail.</p> <br> <br><p>Laura Kipnis is the author of <i>Against Love: A Polemic</i> and <i>The Female Thing: Dirt, Sex, Envy, Vulnerability</i>, which have been translated into fifteen languages.

Tom LoBianco, a longtime Pence reporter, cuts to the core of the nation&#x2019;s most enigmatic politician in this intimate yet expansive account of the vice president&#x2019;s journey to the White House. In <em>Piety &amp; Power, </em>LoBianco follows Pence from his evangelical conversion in college to his failed career as a young lawyer, to his thwarted attempts at politics until he hitched his wagon to far-right extremism, becoming the Congressional poster boy for faith-based policy and Tea Party rhetoric. Giving readers a minute-by-minute account of the selection process that made him Donald Trump&#x2019;s unlikely running mate in 2016, <em>Piety &amp; Power </em>traces Pence&#x2019;s personal and political life, painting a picture of a man driven by faith and conviction, yes, but also a hunger for power. </p><p>LoBianco crafts a revealing portrait of the real Mike Pence&#x2014;a politician whose understated style masks a drive for power, but also a surprising political acumen&#x2014;by drawing on years of research, over one hundred exclusive interviews with those closest to the vice president, and deep ties both within the Beltway and Indiana state politics. Highlighting Pence&#x2019;s strained, at times obsequious, relationship with Trump; his marriage to Karen; his deeply repressed personality; his presidential aspirations and plans for America&#x2019;s future; and his deep-rooted faith in his country, in God, and ultimately himself; <em>Piety &amp; Power </em>provides insights and answers as it sheds light on this ambitious Midwestern politician, his past, and his possible future.</p></p><p><p>Tom LoBianco covers the Trump Russia investigation and the White House for the Associated Press, and is a regular political analyst on CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, NPR, and other broadcast outlets.

Sure to be the subject of much thought and debate, this is the <i>perfect</i> book for all NBA fans.</p><p>Chapter One<br><b>Larry Bird--Foreward</b><br><br>Confidence<br><br><i>by Jackie MacMullan</i><br>In 1986 the NBA concocted a novel way to spice up its weekend of All-Star festivities--a three-point contest for the top marksmen in the league to show off their shooting prowess.<br><br>On the day of the competition, Boston Celtics forward Larry Bird sauntered into the locker room where his fellow participants were dressing.<br><br>"Hey, guys," Bird chortled. "Which one of you is going to finish second?"<br><br>It's one thing to say it. It's another thing to back it up. Bird validated his bravado by easily outdistancing Craig Hodges 22-12 in the finals--even though he had finished fourth in the preliminary round and just barely advanced. But as the field narrowed, Bird's shooting improved. The higher the stakes, the more confident he became.<br><br>"I'm the three-point king!" he gleefully announced within seconds of winning the competition.<br><br>He was also a three-time NBA champion, the leader of an irreverent Celtics team whose swagger served notice that losing was out of the question. No deficit was too large to overcome, and no one player was too dominating for them to contain. Boston derived much of its personality from Bird, who was as adept at making grand pronouncements as he was at fulfilling them.<br><br>Consider Game 4 of the 1984 Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Celtics had already lost one home game and been trampled in Game 3, 137-104, at the Forum to fall behind 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Before the critics could level the Celtics for their miserable performance, Bird landed the first blow. He called his team "a bunch of sissies" and recommended they report to the nearest emergency room for twelve heart transplants. The stinging words quickly produced the desired results in his own locker room. Boston returned home angry and edgy. Yet their captain wasn't done talking. The final salvo Bird delivered was directed toward the Lakers.<br><br>"We will win the world championship," he declared.<br><br>To do so, Bird knew he had to shake free from Michael Cooper, L.A.'s superb wiry forward, who lay in bed at night with his wife and watched game films of his celebrated Celtics opponent. Boston also needed to be more physical with the Lakers to prevent them from running the Celtics ragged with their transition game.<br><br>With goading from both Bird and teammate M. L. Carr, forward Kevin McHale permanently changed the tenor of the series in Game 4 when he clotheslined Lakers forward Kurt Rambis as he drove to the basket on the break. A rejuvenated Boston team, which had fallen behind by ten (68-58) at halftime and was down five with a minute left in regulation, forced overtime on a Robert Parish three-point play and a pair of Bird free throws. Larry almost won it in regulation with an off-balance leaner that rolled off the rim. As the Celtics huddled up Bird assured his teammates, "Get me a good look, and I'll win it for us."<br><br>That look came with sixteen seconds to play in OT, shortly after Lakers star Magic Johnson missed two free throws.<br><br>"I was coming across the lane," Bird recalled, "and faked one way, then went the other. Cooper fell down, and that meant Magic had to pick me up. I was actually glad Magic was on me. He was a great defender, but I knew I could post him up."<br><br>Bird systematically backed Johnson in, then swished a turnaround jumper over his outstretched hand. The Celtics won the game, 129-125, and they went on to win the championship--just as Bird had predicted they would. Bird went home with the league MVP trophy and the grudging admiration of his NBA rivals, who knew better than to question whether number 33 would honor his words with actions.<br><br>"At that point of my career, I had all the confidence in the world," Bird said. "When I took a shot, I believed it was going in, every time. I had taken so many shots, I couldn't imagine missing. I only thought in positive terms.<br><br>"People talk about being in a 'zone.' I've been there. It's when you just know you've got control of the whole game. It's hard to explain, but your reactions are quicker, and the rim looks bigger, and your eyes have better focus.<br><br>"I've always done a lot of shooting on my own in the summer. I got to the point where I could hit eighty to a hundred in a row without missing. That leads to a feeling of 'Give me the ball. I know I can make it.' "<br><br>Even later in his career, ravaged by injuries to his heels, elbow, and back that limited his practice time, Bird didn't abandon his strut. In 1990 he ventured to New York City to play the Knicks amid whispers that his game was in decline. Late in the first quarter he received the ball in the right corner of the court. Parish set a pick to free him, leaving Knicks center Patrick Ewing, a full three inches taller than Bird, to sprint out and cover him on the switch.<br><br>"Here's what I'm going to do," Bird growled. "I'm going to fake once, drive past you, then put in an underhand scoop layup."<br><br>Ewing, crouching lower into his defensive stance, shot back, "Like hell you are."<br><br>Bird rose up as if to shoot the jumper, then put the ball on the floor. He scooted past Ewing underneath, then upfaked once more. As Ewing scurried to recover, the most confident player in the NBA proceeded to do exactly what he said he'd do: he rolled in an underhand scoop shot against the irritated center for two points.<br><br>"Face!" Bird said softly as he ran back down the court. His body may have been on borrowed time, but his mind was still itching to spar with anyone who would take him on, particularly a friend like Ewing, who committed the egregious error of doubting him.<br><br>"If someone said I couldn't do something," Bird said, "I wasn't going to stop until I did it."<br><br>In fact, it was an offhand comment by Parish before the inaugural three-point contest at the 1986 All-Star Game that supplied Bird with all the motivation he needed.<br><br>"Robert said there was no way I was going to win it," Bird said. "He said all the little guards out on the perimeter who make their living hitting shots like that would. He just couldn't see a six-foot-nine-inch forward going out and doing it.<br><br>"I was ticked. I went in there saying, 'I'm going to show him.' "<br><br>Bird spent hours after practice preparing for the competition with Celtics teammates Danny Ainge and Scott Wedman, two excellent long-ball shooters. He left nothing to chance, importing red, white, and blue balls into his workout, knowing they would be used in the competition and would be worth a point more than the regular balls. He positioned the five racks around the three-point arc in deliberate fashion, always placing them in the same spot, with the seams lined up uniformly. He simulated timed rounds and tallied his results in his head. By the time he arrived in Dallas, Bird wasn't just the most confident contestant, he was also the most prepared.<br><br>He also enjoyed another advantage that prompted him to issue his now-famous declaration of superiority: an uncommon level of concentration that enabled him to block out any distractions. That, Bird believed, helped develop a reservoir of confidence that was not easily drained.<br><br>"For some guys, going out and being part of a big event like that with all sorts of people cheering and talking to you and making noise is difficult," Bird said. "To me, it was nothing. I got out there and focused on the rim and blocked everything else out. When I did that, the basket looked big enough to fit <i>two</i>."<br><br>Bird agreed to defend his three-point title in 1987 in Seattle, but soon developed severe problems with his shooting elbow and refrained from issuing any bold predictions. On the morning of the three-point competition he woke up and tried to straighten his elbow, but it remained locked up. He quickly dialed up Dan Dyrek, his physical therapist, who spent the hours leading up to the competition manipulating the elbow to regain some of its flexibility. As Bird pulled on his uniform and walked onto the court, he turned to his girlfriend (now wife), Dinah Mattingly, and said, "If I win this year, I'll never lose again."<br><br>He defended his title by edging Detlef Schrempf and Cooper and took particular pleasure in beating fourth-place finisher Ainge, who had helped him prepare in 1986 but had vowed to beat him in 1987.<br><br>The All-Star venue switched to Chicago in 1988, and again Bird strolled into the locker room asking who would finish behind him. The muted response from the players led him to believe that he had already eliminated half the field with his pregame histrionics.<br><br>Bird's primary challenger that day was Dale Ellis, one of the top snipers in the league. But Bird was healthy and had eased himself into the kind of rhythm that made shooting threes as easy as tossing rolled-up shirts into a laundry basket. Ellis had put up a score of 15 when Bird took the court as the final contestant. He revealed a hint of a smile when he got to the last rack, then buried the first three balls. He had already ensured at least a tie with Ellis when he lofted the final red, white, and blue ball, extending his index finger to signify number one as it took flight. The ball dropped through, and his reputation as a clutch performer was further cemented.<br><br>Asked how long he planned to enter the three-point competition, Bird answered, "Until I lose." Laughter accompanied his answer. Would anyone else ever win it?<br><br>They would. Bird missed all but six games the following season after undergoing heel surgery. Ellis took the three-point crown in his absence. Bird returned in 1990 in Miami, but by then chronic back problems had joined his balky heels as a persistent--and often debilitating--distraction. He sat out twenty-two games in 1989-90 and missed countless more workouts.<br><br>"I lose confi...The National Basketball Association takes an unusual approach in creating a team of all-time greats. Instead of relying on statistics, the organization chose each player because he possesses one of 12 qualities that former NBA coach Daly says "all winning teams must possess." While this selection method leads to a few surprises&#x2014;John Havilcek (who excels in "perpetual motion and hustle") and Bill Laimbeer ("intensity")&#x2014;the rest of the team consists of the usual suspects, including Michael Jordan ("will to win"), Larry Bird ("confidence") and Magic Johnson ("leadership"). Each person and his defining quality gets his own chapter written by a different prominent sportswriter. The chapters brim with information that will interest fans, but many of the qualities are interchangeable among this collection of winning athletes. The book succeeds when the writers delve into the players' upbringings and college years, illuminating what went into creating the qualities they display on the court. Another highlight is the section where the athletes themselves assemble their own best teams, which will help fuel the debate about which players really are the best.

The 20th episode, <i>Blue at the Mizzen</i>, is another swashbuckling adventure on the high seas, complete with romantic escapades from smoggy London to Sierra Leone, diplomacy, espionage, the intricacies of warfare, and imperial brinksmanship. As always, these events are bound up in the ongoing friendship between two officers of the Royal Navy. Jack Aubrey is the naval captain, bold yet compassionate, innovative yet cautious, as fearless in war as he is bumbling in affairs of the heart and household. His boon companion Stephen Maturin is the ship's surgeon--and additionally a spy for the British government, a wealthy Catalonian aristocrat, a doting Irish father, and an avid naturalist.<p> That may sound like a lot to keep track of. However, it's not necessary to carry around a scorecard or ship's roster while reading <i>Blue at the Mizzen</i>. The ostensible issue is whether Jack will finally be promoted to Admiral of the Blue. But long before he hears any word from the Napoleonic era's equivalent of Personnel, he loses half his crew to desertion, his ship undergoes a disastrous collision, and the entire company comes close to perishing in the ice-choked seas off Cape Horn. Meanwhile, the widowed Maturin issues a surprising proposal of marriage to a beautiful, mud-bespattered fellow naturalist while trekking through an African mangrove swamp. (The two lovebirds happen to be searching for a rare variant of <i>Caprimulgus longipennis</i>, the long-tailed nightjar, which they hope to surprise in full mating plumage.)</p><p> Still, this is hardly a plot-driven novel. O'Brian takes time to get anywhere, and invariably enjoys the journey more than the arrival. So even as we get constant hints of the climax to come--Jack's spectacular naval action on behalf of the infant Republic of Chile--we don't mind hearing about the nuances of shipboard existence or the secret life of the white-faced tree duck. We're treated, for example, to this snippet about managed care, circa 1816: </p><blockquote> Poll, Maggie and a horse-leech from the starboard watch have been administering enemas to the many, many cases of gross surfeit that have now replaced the frostbites, torsions, and debility of the recent past, the very recent past. Strong, fresh, seal-meat has not its equal for upsetting the seaman's metabolism: he is much better kept on biscuits, Essex cheese, and a very little well-seethed salt pork--kept on short commons. </blockquote> And we're grateful! We can only hope that the elderly author will favor us with at least one more novel, so that his avid followers can avoid their own form of short commons. Life without Aubrey and Maturin would be a deprivation indeed. <i>--Andrew Himes</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Repairing Pottery and Porcelain: A Practical Guide, 2nd edition</h2><p>This fully-illustrated step-by-step guide clearly takes the student, the amateur, and the professional restorer through each stage of restoration, tackling the simple, the difficult, and the seemingly impossible jobs by providing practical information on every aspect of the ceramic repair process.

But behind the fa�ade of neighborhood coffee klatches and carpools, Paige is growing restless with her increasingly busy spouse, the early onset of her ten-year-old daughter&#x2019;s teenage hostility, and her young son&#x2019;s alarming preoccupation with bodily functions.<br><br>When her friend and neighbor, Karen, looking even more vibrant and gorgeous than usual, confesses to a passionate affair with a sizzling Latin lover, Paige assesses her own state of domestic ecstasy: not good. But Paige&#x2019;s attempts to &#x201c;re-sexualize&#x201d; her marriage produce comically calamitous consequences.<br><br>Just when Paige begins to wonder whether an extramarital remedy may be the key to happiness, Karen is found dead in her garage, lying in a pool of blood. The residents of Aberdeen Mists may be satisfied with the freak accident theory&#x2013;that Karen fell and hit her head on a metal toolbox&#x2013;but Paige knows the adulterous secret that could blow the closed case wide open.<br><br>With sleuthing skills acquired from her favorite TV crime dramas, Paige vows to find out the truth. Her list of potential perps (that&#x2019;s what Law &amp; Order calls them, right?) includes Karen&#x2019;s aggrieved husband, Doug, and sexy Spanish lothario Javier. As Paige&#x2019;s Miss Marple&#x2014;esque adventure winds through her allegedly quiet enclave to the boundaries of her own fidelity, what she uncovers may prove more shocking than she ever imagined.<br><br>In this outrageously entertaining gem, Robyn Harding shines a light on the plight of suburban housewives&#x2013;the sacrifices, the secrets, and the desperate lengths they&#x2019;ll go to to keep up appearances. With a sharp wit and a delightfully unpredictable story line, Harding&#x2019;s darkly funny novel examines whether the grass really is greener on the other side of the white picket fence . . . or if it&#x2019;s just a good place to bury a body.</p><p>Robyn Harding is the author of The Journal of Mortifying Moments. In her indecisive youth, she studied English literature, journalism, and marketing before embarking on a seven-year career in the advertising industry. She lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, with her husband and two young children. Say hi at www.robynharding.com.We were loading coffee cups into the dishwasher when my friend Karen made a startling confession.<br><br> &#x201c;I have something to tell you,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; I continued tipping the dregs of cold coffee into the sink and plunking the empty cups into the top tray. It was a Wednesday, the day the five of us got together for coffee and conversation. This week, it had been my turn to host. When the others left to pick up various children from preschool, run errands, or go to the gym, Karen had volunteered to stay behind and help me clean up. Although . . . she wasn&#x2019;t really helping anymore. Now she was just standing there, leaning against the blue tiles of my kitchen island, with a strange look on her face.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t judge me, okay?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; This time, I stopped what I was doing and looked at my friend. Her cheeks were pink under her late-summer tan, and she seemed to be trying to maintain a somber expression while on the verge of hysterical giggles.<br><br> &#x201c;Umm . . .&#x201d; She cleared her throat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been seeing someone.&#x201d;<br><br> I was silent for a few moments, choosing my words carefully. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s nothing to feel ashamed of. I&#x2019;ve often thought I should get some therapy to deal with my parents&#x2019; divorce. I know I was twenty-seven when they split up, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that it didn&#x2019;t still hurt.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not seeing a shrink, Paige.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh . . .&#x201d; It took me a second. &#x201c;Oh!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You promised not to judge me!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m not! It&#x2019;s just that . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just shocked, that&#x2019;s all. I thought that you and Doug were so happy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We were happy. But when I met . . . this person,&#x201d; Karen said, blushing again and forcing away the delighted smile that was threatening to curl her lips, &#x201c;I realized that my relationship with Doug just wasn&#x2019;t enough for me. I know it sounds terrible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well . . . ,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to look down on me for this, then I won&#x2019;t say any more.&#x201d; Karen moved to retrieve her coat off the back of a kitchen chair.<br><br> &#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t go,&#x201d; I soothed, realizing that I had offended her. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s have some more cake and talk.&#x201d; I cut two enormous slabs of Sara Lee apple-cinnamon coffee cake and led her to the breakfast nook. When we were seated at the pine kitchen table in the sunny alcove, I took a moment to study my friend. The sun streaming in through the bank of windows picked up the highlights in her chestnut hair and gave her complexion a golden glow. With her sparkling blue eyes and flush of delighted embarrassment, she looked almost impossibly girlish and pretty&#x2014;far younger than her thirty-six years. Extramarital sex obviously agreed with her.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay . . . ,&#x201d; I said gently. &#x201c;Tell me how this happened.&#x201d; Of course, I was trying to be a supportive and nonjudgmental friend, but a small part of me was positively gleeful! This was the most exciting news I&#x2019;d heard in years. Our Denver suburb was very quiet.<br><br> &#x201c;Well . . . ,&#x201d; she began, daintily picking at the drizzled icing with her fork tines. &#x201c;Like I said, Doug and I were happy. We have the big house, the nice cars, the time-share in Playa del Carmen. . . . I was content, complacent even. But sexually&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> I choked on my mouthful of cake. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; I mumbled. &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sexually, I wasn&#x2019;t fulfilled. You know we&#x2019;ve been trying to get pregnant for almost two years now, thanks to Doug&#x2019;s low-mobility sperm. That&#x2019;s really taken the fun out of it&#x2014;the schedules, the ovulation predictor, the cold packs in Doug&#x2019;s shorts . . .&#x201d;<br><br> I managed to refrain from choking again, but I was sure I&#x2019;d never look at Karen&#x2019;s CFO husband the same way again.<br><br> &#x201c;Sex should be spontaneous! Passionate! Sex should make you feel like you are the most beautiful, sensual creature on the planet, like you could conquer the world.&#x201d;<br><br> I was nodding along here, but it had been a very long time since sex had made me feel anything but . . . good. If it had ever made me feel like a world conqueror, I couldn&#x2019;t remember it.<br><br> &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s how I feel when I make love with Javier. It&#x2019;s mind-blowing! I&#x2019;ve never had this kind of sex with Doug.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Javier?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s Spaaaanish!&#x201d; She said this like she was saying &#x201c;He&#x2019;s covered in chocolate.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Where did you meet him?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;At my art class. I know it&#x2019;s wrong, Paige, but I swear, he&#x2019;s completely irresistible!&#x201d; Cue the pink cheeks and girlish giggles.<br><br> &#x201c;Spanish and an artist,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That does sound pretty irresistible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not an artist. He&#x2019;s the model.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh! Wow!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, I know,&#x201d; she practically squealed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s also a barista&#x2014;to make ends meet. He doesn&#x2019;t care about status, and he doesn&#x2019;t want to get caught up in the rat race. It&#x2019;s a different culture, a different attitude.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, I, personally, love coffee,&#x201d; I said gamely.<br><br> &#x201c;He is just so beautiful, inside and out&#x2014;and not in that plastic, Hollywood kind of way. His face has so much character. That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;s so great to draw. And his body is unbelievable! And his eyes! Oh God, Paige, his eyes&#x2014;they smolder.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Smolder, eh?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know what else to say.<br><br> &#x201c;Smolder,&#x201d; she said, flopping back in her chair with a positively postcoital sigh.<br><br> I cleared my throat. &#x201c;He sounds amazing, but . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s not just his looks. He really gets me, you know? Like, he can see who I am&#x2014;the real me&#x2014;deep down inside. There&#x2019;s a bit of a language barrier, of course, but it&#x2019;s almost like we transcend words.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Umm . . . okay. But what does this mean for you and Doug?&#x201d;<br><br> She sat forward and stabbed a forkful of cake. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. When this all started, I thought it would be a fling. It was just passion, just lust in the beginning. But now . . . we have so much more.&#x201d; She stuffed the cake into her mouth.<br><br> &#x201c;Do you still love Doug?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course I do,&#x201d; she mumbled through her apple-cinnamon confection, &#x201c;but isn&#x2019;t it possible to love someone and yet not feel a real emotional connection to him?&#x201d;<br><br> I thought about my own marriage for a second. Paul and I had celebrated our twelfth anniversary last month, but would I say we had a real emotional connection? We certainly did have one when we were first together, but over the last ten years, things had changed. His life revolved around his job in software sales, and mine had been focused on our two kids. But I still loved him. He was my husband, the father of my children . . . &#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s possible,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> &#x201c;And now I just want to be with Javier all the time! Honestly, Paige, I can&#x2019;t get enough of him&#x2014;physically, emotionally, spiritually. I don&#x2019;t know how much longer I can keep up this fa�ade with Doug.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But, Karen,&#x201d; I said solemnly, &#x201c;you and Doug have a life together. You and Javier just have great sex.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; A humorless laugh erupted from within her. &#x201c;Doug and I have things together, possessions. That&#x2019;s not a life, Paige: Javier taught me that. Seriously . . .&#x201d;&#x2014;she looked at me intently&#x2014;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m beginning to think there was a reason I couldn&#x2019;t get pregnant. If I had a baby with Doug, I&#x2019;d be tied to him forever.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;True,&#x201d; I murmured. My own fruitful marriage suddenly felt like a life sentence in Sing Sing.<br><br> Karen suddenly looked at her watch. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to go.&#x201d; She jumped up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a bikini wax at noon.&#x201d; I followed her down the hall and into the front foyer, a large open space with an Italian tiled floor and high, coved ceiling. This &#x201c;grand entryway,&#x201d; as the architect had called it, was a common feature in the area&#x2019;s newer homes. Undoubtedly, it was intended to give the impression of a Georgian manor or something, but the piles of kids&#x2019; shoes, sporting equipment, and schoolbooks tended to detract from its grandeur. I waited patiently while Karen slipped into her chocolate leather blazer, zipping up her matching stiletto boots.<br><br> &#x201c;Thanks for coffee,&#x201d; she said, taking my hands in hers. &#x201c;And thanks for listening. Really, I was bursting to talk to someone, and you&#x2019;re the only person I felt safe telling my secret to.&#x201d;<br><br> I have to admit, I was somewhat surprised by this. Not that I couldn&#x2019;t keep a secret. I could. I felt fairly confident that I would take this information to my grave&#x2014;even though it was the juiciest thing to happen in Aberdeen Mists for about eight years. But although Karen and I were very close, I wouldn&#x2019;t really have considered us confidantes. In fact, I would have thought she&#x2019;d have had a more open and sharing kind of relationship with some of the other women in our clique. So why had she chosen me?<br><br> Karen was probably closest to Carly, who lived two houses away from me and six houses away from Karen. She was a more recent...</p><h2>Making a Modern Classic: The Architecture of the Philadelphia Museum of Art</h2><p>Architecture, art history, and city politics come together in this lively account of the evolution of the building that houses the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The story spans the decades of planning and construction that preceded the 1928 opening of the &#34;wonderful Greek garage&#34; on Fairmount through the reinstallation projects of the 1990s. The text is richly documented by both archival photographs and superb new color photog-raphy. Index.</p><p><b>David B.

Here is hope, healing, and a chance to recover the self lost in childhood. Drawing on his extensive work with Adult Children, and on his own experience as a survivor of emotional neglect, therapist Steven Farmer demonstrates that through exercises and journal work, his program can help lead you through grieving your lost childhood, to become your own parent, and integrate the healing aspects of spiritual, physical, and emotional recovery into your adult life.</p><p>The violent forms of child abuse that make headlines are not the only ones that leave lifelong scars. A child who grows up in an unstable environment where empathy, clear boundaries and trust are lacking, can end up living a ravaged adulthood. Children can be crippled by mixed messages, family secrets and reversed parent-child roles. Many victims of these practices are not even sure their childhood was abusive. This balanced, practical guide delineates traits of abusive families. Narrative vignettes in each section illustrate and personalize critical issues. Most valuable is the step-by-step self-help program that includes exercises and journal work for recovery.Steven Farmer&#39;s books include CORACLE, Tone Ward, WORLD OF SHIELDS, Standing Water, MEDIEVAL, and GLOWBALL. He holds a BA in Writing from UCSD and an MA in English from Sonoma State U, where he studied under poet David Bromige.

The Korean War should have been about over. The Chinese warned the Americans that if they crossed the 38th parallel they would come into the war. But General Douglas MacArthur ignored the warning and ordered the 1st Marine Division to go north to the Yalu River. On November 27, 80,000 Chinese soldiers attacked and surrounded 15,000 Marines at a place called Chosin Reservoir. <br><br>The Savior is the graphic historical novel of how the quiet, reserved Major General risked his own career to save his men, leading them in a brutal 78-mile fight to the sea in sub-zero conditions. It's the fascinating, gripping saga of the most famous and successful breakout in American military history.</p><p></p><h2>War of Intervention in Angola: Volume 1 - Angolan and Cuban Forces at War, 1975-1976 (Africa@War)</h2><p>As of 1975, the decades long insurgency in Angola appeared to be short of its conclusion. However, with no less than three major insurgent movements fighting for supremacy, the war went on and then South Africa, USA, the Soviet Union, Zaire and Cuba became involved.<br><br>Affairs like the CIA&#x2019;s efforts to destabilize Angola for little else but to recoup its prestige after the catastrophic defeat in South Vietnam, or the South African military intervention in Angola &#x2013; Operation Savannah &#x2013; have attracted lots of public attention and are relatively well covered in related publications. On the contrary, the final stages of the Portuguese withdrawal, the military buildup of three native insurgent forces, and then the onset of the Cuban military intervention in Angola &#x2013; Operation Carlotta run in 1975 and 1976 &#x2013; remain largely unknown.<br><br>Based on extensive research with help of Angolan and Cuban sources, the War of Intervention in Angola is providing a unique insight precisely into the latter topic. It traces the failures of the US-supported FNLA, the growth and reorganization of the MPLA into a conventional army; deployment of Cuban military contingents, their capabilities and intentions; and the performance and experiences of the MPLA and Cuban forces at war with South Africans and the third Angolan insurgent group &#x2013; UNITA.<br><br>The volume is illustrated with over 100 rare photographs, a dozen of maps and 15 color profiles.</p><p>Tom Cooper is an Austrian aerial warfare analyst and historian.

Flora Vaughn said this too loudly about all overdressed woman who had just passed their table. Then Flora looked meaningfully at Leni Salomon. Both of them wore the same color of fingernail polish matte brown.Isabelle Neukor looked from one woman to the other and smiled. They were her best friends; they were all thirty-two and had grown up together. But her friends could not save her now. No one could.Leni's cane leaned against her thigh like a silent devoted dog. She walked with a pronounced limp--her left leg was shorter than the right. She was also the best-looking af the three women but like most genuinely good-looking people, paid it little mind.Leni Salomon and Flora Vaughn had husbands, Isabelle did not. Leni and Flora were not in love with their men, Isabelle was. Strange things had been happening to her lately; so strange that she could not believe some of them. Even after all that had happened in the last months, she could not believe these recent events had actually taken place. She had told no one about any of them, not even Vincent."Guess who died, like, a <i>year</i> ago but I just heard about it?" Florasat back and dropped her large pink napkin dramatically onto her plate of half-eaten asparagus. She was given to stagy gestures it was her way. She had a big man's laugh. She used a lot of body language when she spoke, as if trying to explain things to a deaf and dumb world. People had different opinions about her looks--some thought she was a knockout, others that she was creepy with her very long auburn hair and almost Oriental eyes. Vincent liked her a lot. He called her "Big Red" after they met the first time and since hearing that, she often signed her notes to anyone "Red."Leni made false teeth gold teeth, bridges, false teeth. She was a dental technician, one of the best around. She loved the job, its intricacies and complications. She called it useful architecture. When anyone asked her a question, she held it up and turning it slowly, looked at it from every angle as if it were a tooth she was making. "Someone we know or someone famous?"Flora looked at Leni and winked. Then her eyes moved over to Isabelle and she said in an oily way "Someone you and I once knew, Leni, but who <i>really</i> wanted to know Isabelle."From a blank "Huh?" Isabelle's expression slid into a frown. A few beats passed until her eyes slowly began to widen in recognition. Aghast, she put a hand in front of her mouth. <i>"Simon?"</i>Flora nodded. "Dead over a year ago."Leni gasped. "Simon Haden died?"Flora steepled her fingers and looked prayerfully toward heaven, like a saint on a kitsch Italian religious postcard.As one, the three women burst out laughing at the fact of Simon Haden's death.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Standing in a giant meadow next to an ugly back longhaired dog named Hietzl, Vincent Ettrich. watcled an airplane sail eight feet above their heads and crash nearby. Ettrich sighed. Hietzl would have sighed too if it had understood how much time and trouble its friendhad put into building that plane. But the dog was so happy just to be out there alone with Vincent that its sigh wouldn't have lasted long.Shaking his head, Ettrich walked to the wrecked model and squatted down next to it, hands on his knees. As was his style, he was dressed like a teenager--ancient washed-out jeans, gray and white skateboarder's sneakers, and a black T-shirt with a picture of John Lennon on it. Ettrich was young-looking anyway. Seeing him for the first time, you would have guessed he was in his thirties rather than the early forties he was.Hietzl heard something and quickly turned its head to the left. Ettrich continued to stare at what was left of his model airplane and wonder what he had done wrong in assembling it. The dog began barking so furiously that Ettrich snapped out of his funk-trance and looked toward where his companion was pointing. Behind them was a giant stand of trees, their leaves blowing in the frisky warm wind. But Hietzl was pointing in the opposite direction--out toward the open field.Puzzled, Ettrich looked down at Hietzl and asked "What? What's there?"The dog ignored him and kept yapping.That annoying rat-a-tat barking and the wind soughing through the trees around them was all there was. It was midsummer; a sky the color of shirt cardboard, the air heavy with humidity. No one else was around.Ettrich came out here often with the dog to walk or lie on his back and look at the clouds. Since moving to Vienna, he had done little besides recover his strength and think about the child Isabelle was going to give birth to soon.Ettrich had died but then been brought back to life by Isabelle. He had crossed and recrossed the great border. While on the other side he'd learned both the language and some of the requisite lessons of the dead. Alive again, he thought his mind had been wiped clean of what he had been exposed to in the short time he had been dead.He was wrong. Ettrich retained everything he had experienced. But to access that room in his mind now, he needed a key to the door. Right now he did not have one.As soon as it was possible for him to travel he and Isabelle had left America and flown to Vienna. Ettrich left his wife, two children, and a life he had once thoroughly enjoyed and felt content with. But he abandoned it all because he wanted to be with Isabelle Neukor. He was willing to throw everything aside so that he could spend the rest of his life with her and their child. Their doubts were over. They had crossed the great bridge between now and then.Hietzl's barking took on a new tone: it was even more urgent, as if there was real danger nearby, or they were right on the brink of something. Ettrich looked again toward where the dog was pointing but saw nothing. Still, Hietzl's agitated tone made him uneasy. For some reason--who knows why?--he turned quickly and glanced back to the place on the ground where his model airplane had crashed a few minutes before. It was gone.Ettrich did not appear surprised. His eyes flicked here and there around the area to make sure this was true. It was--the model had disappeared. Only then did a kind of alarm show on his face. The dog was right--real trouble <i>had</i> just arrived."Hietzl."The dog stopped a moment, and then continued barking."Stop it! Come on, we've got to go right now." Ettrich touched the dog on top of its head. Then he began walking back toward his car as fast as he could manage. He had not healed completely so he couldn't run. But he would have.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Two hundred yards behind them among the thick stand of trees stood another man and his dog. This man's name was John Flannery. He was portly and rather short. He wore a trimmed salt-and-pepper beard. People sometimes remarked on the resemblance between himand photos of the older Ernest Hemingway. Flannery always liked hearing that. He'd never read Hemingway but liked who he was.Today he wore a brand-new blue T-shirt that wasn't tucked into a pair of brand-new beige shorts covered with lots of pockets. Oddly, he was barefoot although he stood on a forest floor covered with a variety of sharp stabby things.The dog, a Great Dane with black spots scattered across its white body like ink spilled on a blotter, was named Luba. It had blue eyes and stood unmoving by Flannery's side. The presence of these two had caused Ettrich's dog to start barking. Interestingly, Hietzl had sensed them but gotten their direction wrong. Ettrich saw northing when he looked toward where Hietzl was yapping because nothing was there. Flannery and Luba stood far behind them, watching impassively, as the other two walked away and finally out of sight. Flannery held Ettrich's model plane in both of his hands. It was whole again and looked like it bad just come new out of a box.When the others were gone, Flannery turned toward the woods and lifted his arm high above his head. With a quick flick of the wrist, he threw the plane into the trees.Defying all laws of logic and gravity, it stayed aloft for the next twenty minutes. Even when the wind around them died completely, the small plane continued flying through the forest--around trees, beneath and above and round and round long crooked grasping branches that normally never would have let it pass. The plane flew right by those branches. It taunted them with loop de loops and sud den swerves to avoid all kinds of collisions that should have happened but didn't.After a while Flannery and Luba sat down on the forest floor to watch this performance. Now and then the man spoke to the dog in a relaxed companionable voice. It looked at him as if it understood every word.At one point Flannery raised his left hand. The wooden plane instantly stopped and hung in the air fifteen feet up, next to a toweringchestnut tree covered with flickering yellow-green leaves. A mile and a half away, Ettrich had started his car and was driving off. Flannery nodded and smiled for the first time, having waited for the sound of those tires crunching across the gravel of the parking lot. I His hand dropped and the plane started flying again."Things <i>look</i> good, but we can't get excited yet. 'Thunder is not yet rain,'" John Flannery said out loud. He loved proverbs. He memorized whole books of them and always had one for any occasion. Suddenly another popped into his head. "Too large a morsel chokes the child." As he thought about it for a few moments, his face lit up in delight. He could use that. Damn right! He could use it this minute to make Vincent Ettrich's life a very, very uncomfortable place to be.He raised his chin a bit toward where the plane was flying. It did a 180-degree turn toward him. As if waiting for instructions, it paused a second or two and then flew away. Out of the forest, away from the trees and Flannery and Luba the dog, the plane flew toward Ettrich and his dog and Isabelle Neukor and their child and the misery these people would soon know. Today was the first day of the end of their lives. Even John Flannery felt sort of sorry for these poor fuckers, if you can believe that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"So how did Haden die?"Sitting back in the chair, Flora Vaughn crossed her arms over her chest. "How come I don't hear a lot of <i>regret</i> in your question, Leni?"Leni rolled her eyes and proceeded to answer for all of them. "Because Simon told the women he wanted to fuck that he was dying so they'd feel sorry for him and go to bed with him. <i>I</i> did, and so did you. I don't care if he's dead."Flora nodded and smiled. "Don't you love the way Leni phrases things so diplomatically? She should be an ambassador to some dangerous country--she'd start World War Three in half an hour. 'Mr. President,your foreign policy sucks. It's obvious you're either completely incompetent, or you've got a small cock and are compensating.""We're not talking about me. <i>How did Simon die?"</i>Flora took a drink of water and then pointed at the glass. "In a car wash."Her answer was so unexpected that spontaneously the three of them broke out laughing again."No, really--how?""That's the truth. Sabine Baar-Baarenfels told me. He died in a car wash in Los Angeles. He had a heart attack while his car was being washed." Some answers in life are so weird yet satisfying that on hearing them, all that the mind can do is sit back and burp.Simon Haden had enthusiastically pursued Isabelle for years, trying every method he knew to get her into bed. Usually he was very good at seduction, a real pro. He used dying, he used love, he used sneaky in numerous, original ways. To his great dismay, none of them worked on her. When they were together, Isabelle was charming and funny and great company, but she always, <i>always</i> knew what Haden was trying to do. Smiling, she invariably stopped him miles from any bedroom door. All of this flashed through her mind now as she stared at Flora Vaughn and digested the fact that Simon was dead."What was he doing in Los Angeles?" Leni's question broke the ice that had formed over the moment."Who cares? But you know what really annoys me? What really bugs me? Now that that <i>villain</i> is dead, I keep thinking sweet things about him. Like the time he brought me lilies, or the time we stayed in bed all morning and ate chocolates. It's not right, damn it. Simon does not <i>deserve</i> sweet thoughts, whether he's dead or alive. The man was a selfish pig who just happened to be handsome enough to be irresistible. But once you'd fallen for the temptation, he treated you like a piece of old gum on the bottom of his shoe."Leni closed her eyes and nodded in agreement. "I felt more likean empty stained pastry box after he left me. But I agree. Who said you can't speak ill of the dead?"Isabelle was only half listening to what her friends were saying. She was feeling sick again and was waiting to see if her stomach was going to hold down the meal she had just eaten or throw it back up. That was one of the only things about pregnancy that bothered her: she would suddenly feel horribly ill, or diarrhea would abruptly come hurtling down her guts like an avalanche. When these things happened she would have to drop everything and bolt for the nearest toilet. It was embarrassing and sometimes frightening to feel that you were not always in control of your own body and its most basic functions.After a few seconds of waiting and listening to her body, Isabelle knew this was going to get worse so she stood up quickly. Both friends looked at her."I'm going to be sick."Instantly concerned, Flora half rose from her chair and pointed across the restaurant toward the toilets. The room was large and Isabelle had a long way to go."Do you want me to come with you?"Isabelle shook her head and started away from the table. Walking fast, she put a hand over her mouth.Flora slowly sat back down but kept watching her friend cross the room. "Do you think I should go anyway? Maybe she needs someone to hold her head."Leni moved her cane a few inches to the right. "Forget it. You know how embarrassing that stuff is. Who wants someone watching while you puke? I still can't believe that Simon is dead."Two good-looking women at a chic restaurant, talking about a lover they'd once shared. Both of them had stories about Simon Haden that the other hadn't heard. Now that he was dead, they could tell them.Time passed while they spoke and laughed. Isabelle did not return to the table. Flora and I eni were both aware of this but it didn't concern them at first. Isabelle was vain--it was not uncommon for her to take a while.Eventually too much time passed and Leni mentioned it. Flora got up immediately and went to the ladies' room. Pushing the door open, she fully expected to see Isabelle standing at one of the mirrors over the sinks, primping and looking at her reflection. She wasn't."Isabelle?" She looked at the two toilet stalls. Both doors were closed. A toilet flushed with a hard <i>whoosh</i> and Flora was momentarily relieved. She was sure her friend was in there. But she wasn't. Instead, a nondescript middle-ag...</p><h2>The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues About the So Called Psychopathic Personality</h2><p>The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues About the So Called Psychopathic Personality 5th Edition by Hervey M.

There have never been more possibilities and opportunities for you to achieve more of your goals than exist today. As perhaps never before in human history, you are actually drowning in options. In fact, there are so many good things that you can do that your ability to decide among them may be the critical determinant of what you accomplish in life.<br><br>If you are like most people today, you are overwhelmed with too much to do and too little time. As you struggle to get caught up, new tasks and responsibilities just keep rolling in, like the waves of the ocean. Because of this, you will never be able to do everything you have to do. You will never be caught up. You will always be behind in some of your tasks and responsibilities, and probably in many of them.<br><br>The Need to Be Selective<br><br>For this reason, and perhaps more than ever before, your ability to select your most important task at each moment, and then to get started on that task and to get it done both quickly and well, will probably have more of an impact on your success than any other quality or skill you can develop.<br><br>An average person who develops the habit of setting clear priorities and getting important tasks completed quickly will run circles around a genius who talks a lot and makes wonderful plans but who gets very little done.<br><br>The Truth about Frogs<br><br>Mark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that that is probably the worst thing that is going to happen to you all day long.<br><br>Your &#x201c;frog&#x201d; is your biggest, most important task, the one you are most likely to procrastinate on if you don't do something about it. It is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and results at the moment.<br><br>The first rule of frog eating is this:<br>If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first.<br><br>This is another way of saying that if you have two important tasks before you, start with the biggest, hardest, and most important task first. Discipline yourself to begin immediately and then to persist until the task is complete before you go on to something else.<br><br>Think of this as a test. Treat it like a personal challenge. Resist the temptation to start with the easier task. Continually remind yourself that one of the most important decisions you make each day is what you will do immediately and what you will do later, if you do it at all.<br><br>The second rule of frog eating is this:<br>If you have to eat a live frog at all, it doesn't pay to sit and look at it for very long.<br><br>The key to reaching high levels of performance and productivity is to develop the lifelong habit of tackling your major task first thing each morning. You must develop the routine of &#x201c;eating your frog&#x201d; before you do anything else and without taking too much time to think about it.<br><br>Take Action Immediately<br><br>In study after study of men and women who get paid more and promoted faster, the quality of &#x201c;action orientation&#x201d; stands out as the most observable and consistent behavior they demonstrate in everything they do. Successful, effective people are those who launch directly into their major tasks and then discipline themselves to work steadily and single-mindedly until those tasks are complete.<br><br>In our world, and especially in our business world, you are paid and promoted for getting specific, measurable results. You are paid for making a valuable contribution and especially for making the most important contribution that is expected of you.<br><br>&#x201c;Failure to execute&#x201d; is one of the biggest problems in organizations today. Many people confuse activity with accomplishment. They talk continually, hold endless meetings, and make wonderful plans, but in the final analysis, no one does the job and gets the results required.<br><br>Develop the Habits of Success<br><br>Your success in life and work will be determined by the kinds of habits that you develop over time. The habit of setting priorities, overcoming procrastination, and getting on with your most important task is a mental and physical skill. As such, this habit is learnable through practice and repetition, over and over again, until it locks into your subconscious mind and becomes a permanent part of your behavior. Once it becomes a habit, it becomes both automatic and easy to do.<br><br>This habit of starting and completing important tasks has an immediate and continuous payoff. You are designed mentally and emotionally in such a way that task completion gives you a positive feeling. It makes you happy. It makes you feel like a winner.<br><br>Whenever you complete a task of any size or importance, you feel a surge of energy, enthusiasm, and self-esteem. The more important the completed task, the happier, more confident, and more powerful you feel about yourself and your world.<br><br>The completion of an important task triggers the release of endorphins in your brain. These endorphins give you a natural &#x201c;high.&#x201d; The endorphin rush that follows successful completion of any task makes you feel more positive, personable, creative, and confident.<br><br>Develop a Positive Addiction<br><br>Here is one of the most important of the so-called secrets of success. You can actually develop a &#x201c;positive addiction&#x201d; to endorphins and to the feeling of enhanced clarity, confidence, and competence that they trigger. When you develop this addiction, you will, at an unconscious level, begin to organize your life in such a way that you are continually starting and completing ever more important tasks and projects. You will actually become addicted, in a very positive sense, to success and contribution.<br><br>One of the keys to your living a wonderful life, having a successful career, and feeling terrific about yourself is to develop the habit of starting and finishing important jobs. When you do, this behavior will take on a power of its own and you'll find it easier to complete important tasks than not to complete them.<br><br>No Shortcuts<br><br>You remember the story of the man who stops a musician on a street in New York and asks how he can get to Carnegie Hall. The musician replies, &#x201c;Practice, man, practice.&#x201d;<br><br>Practice is the key to mastering any skill. Fortunately, your mind is like a muscle. It grows stronger and more capable with use. With practice, you can learn any behavior or develop any habit that you consider either desirable or necessary.<br><br>The Three Ds of New Habit Formation<br><br>You need three key qualities to develop the habits of focus and concentration, which are all learnable. They are decision, discipline, and determination.<br><br>First, make a decision to develop the habit of task completion. Second, discipline yourself to practice the principles you are about to learn over and over until they become automatic. And third, back everything you do with determination until the habit is locked in and becomes a permanent part of your personality.<br><br>Visualize Yourself as You Want to Be<br><br>There is a special way that you can accelerate your progress toward becoming the highly productive, effective, efficient person that you want to be. It consists of your thinking continually about the rewards and benefits of being an action-oriented, fast-moving, and focused person. See yourself as the kind of person who gets important jobs done quickly and well on a consistent basis.<br><br>Your mental picture of yourself has a powerful effect on your behavior. Visualize yourself as the person you intend to be in the future. Your self-image, the way you see yourself on the inside, largely determines your performance on the outside. All improvements in your outer life begin with improvements on the inside, in your mental pictures.<br><br>You have a virtually unlimited ability to learn and develop new skills, habits, and abilities. When you train yourself, through repetition and practice, to overcome procrastination and get your most important tasks completed quickly, you will move yourself onto the fast track in your life and career and step on the accelerator.<br><br>Eat That Frog!</p><h2>In Search of Wagner (Radical Thinkers)</h2><p>Written in exile from Germany, this potent study of Europe&#x2019;s most controversial composer explodes the frontiers of musical and cultural analysis. Measuring key elements of Wagner&#x2019;s oeuvre with patent musical dexterity, Adorno sheds light on a nineteenth-century bourgeois figure whose operas betray the social gestures and high-culture fantasies that helped plant the seeds of the modern Culture Industry.

Lloyd Mueller is like beer fudge. Enjoy it now because it only has a shelf life of about three days.&#x201d;</p><p>I shivered at what she&#x2019;d just insinuated. But nobody contradicted my Belgian grandmother, especially when she was upset. And yet I plunged in like a ninny. &#x201c;Grandma, Lloyd is a good landlord. Or was. At least he&#x2019;s giving me a refund for making me move out of this rental cabin early. He&#x2019;s bringing the check to the meeting at the fudge shop. And please don&#x2019;t talk about him having a shelf life.&#x201d; My skin rippled again, this time with big goose bumps. &#x201c;You make it sound like somebody will do him in for having me move.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bah and booyah! Maybe he should watch out! You&#x2019;re moving out of this lovely cabin and then moving into the storage room of your fudge shop? Whoever heard of living in a fudge shop! This is going to be trouble for you and worse for Lloyd!&#x201d; Exclamation points spat out of her mouth as my grandmother splashed suds about the fudge utensils in my cabin&#x2019;s kitchen sink.</p><p>My cabin was one of several rentals along the three-block length of Duck Marsh Street in Fishers&#x2019; Harbor, a tourist town on peninsular Door County, Wisconsin, which juts into Lake Michigan. Our county was known as the Cape Cod of the Midwest. In the summer our village&#x2019;s population of two hundred swelled to a couple of thousand when the condos and summer homes filled with vacationers from Chicago and beyond.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it,&#x201d; Grandma said, persisting. We Belgians are like that, the old &#x201c;dog on a bone,&#x201d; never giving up. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s up to no good.&#x201d;</p><p>I had to admit I felt the same way. Everybody knew everybody&#x2019;s business here. Lloyd was the richest man in town by far. All we knew was that he intended to buy the Blue Heron Inn, but he wasn&#x2019;t telling anybody his intentions except to say it wouldn&#x2019;t be an inn anymore. People all over town were nervous about the secrecy. Even Lloyd&#x2019;s ex-wife, Libby&#x2014;who got along with him fine&#x2014;had told my grandma she was worried about the mysterious surprise he had cooking for Fishers&#x2019; Harbor. Libby said he wouldn&#x2019;t even tell her. What did that mean? That he was up to no good, as Grandma said?</p><p>It was hard for me to worry too much about this big secret at the moment. I was in the living room packing books in a hurry in sticky July humidity. It was Friday morning after the Fourth, and I&#x2019;d told Lloyd I&#x2019;d be out by Sunday. I could fuss and ask for thirty days&#x2019; notice, but Lloyd&#x2014;for all his faults&#x2014;was also my grandfather&#x2019;s old high school buddy. Besides, I liked the thought of living in a fudge shop. The early-morning fog was being steamed by the sun, steeping me like a tea bag. My long brown hair in a twist atop my head was coming undone on my damp neck, and my trademark pink blouse was beginning to stick to my back.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been up since five, the water had been cut off in my fudge shop today, and the birdcall clock over the sink had just cardinal-chirped eight o&#x2019;clock, which panicked me. In a half hour I had to meet up with the fudge contest judges and confectioner chef contestants at my shop. Fortunately, Oosterlings&#x2019; Live Bait, Bobbers &amp; Belgian Fudge &amp; Beer was only about thirty feet away across my backyard. It sat on the docks of our Lake Michigan harbor.</p><p>Grandma said amid pans rattling in the sink, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why you can&#x2019;t live in our sunporch for now.&#x201d;</p><p>Grandma and Grandpa Oosterling lived across the way, in one of only two cabins on this street not owned by Lloyd Mueller. Moving in with my Grandma Sophie and Grandpa Gil would be convenient, but I was thirty-two, and I&#x2019;d heard too many jokes about thirtysomethings moving back in with family to be comfortable with the invitation.</p><p>&#x201c;Grandma, I&#x2019;ll be fine. I need to worry about settling on a new fudge flavor for next week&#x2019;s contest.&#x201d; I tossed more cookbooks and scriptwriting books into the next empty box sitting near me on the floor by the couch.</p><p>&#x201c;You like Brussels sprouts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sprout fudge?&#x201d; I swallowed down my gag reflex, then heard her squelch a giggle. My grandma was like that, always keeping me on my toes. &#x201c;What fairy tale is that based on?&#x201d; From the start of my business I had decided that all my fudge flavors for females had to be named for a fairy tale.</p><p>Grandma said, &#x201c;The story of the Three Bears. Porridge fudge.&#x201d;</p><p>Smiling at that flavor, I countered, &#x201c;Maybe a Goldilocks flavor, something in gold? I&#x2019;m not sure what flavor that could be, but it needs to be as nice as my cherry-vanilla Cinderella Pink Fudge.&#x201d; The Cinderella fudge had become an instant hit with the tourists. &#x201c;I want something gal pals will savor with a fine Door County wine or that their little girls would find cute and fun for their tea parties. I&#x2019;m starting to panic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, the sweet success of your first fudge flavor is pressuring you.&#x201d; Grandma Sophie wrestled a big stainless steel mixer bowl into the sink. &#x201c;Come over for dinner tonight and we&#x2019;ll brainstorm. And move your stuff into our cabin. Whoever heard of living in a storage room amid milk, cream, and mice!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There are no mice in my fudge shop, Grandma. There&#x2019;s only Titus here in the cabin, in the bottom cupboard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you named a mouse. Bah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, he wouldn&#x2019;t climb into my traps for cheese or even peanut butter, so I figured I&#x2019;d give him a name and then just call him out of hiding.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Booyah to you.&#x201d; The word &#x201c;booyah&#x201d; refers to a traditional Belgian celebration stew made with chicken and vegetables, but now the word is used all the time as a cheer word. Grandma continued as she swished suds around the bowl. &#x201c;That mouse will have more living space than you. And moving now is the worst possible time to do it in your life. Lloyd should be ashamed of himself for telling the new owner you&#x2019;d be gone by Sunday sometime. Who do you suppose he sold these cabins to?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe Libby&#x2019;s learned more. I&#x2019;ll ask her. I have to stop over at the lighthouse later with her batch of fudge anyway.&#x201d; I sneezed from the books as I packed another box on the floor. I hadn&#x2019;t dusted anything since I arrived in town in late April. Opening and operating the fudge shop had kept me too busy. &#x201c;Grandma, maybe we should just be happy that Lloyd isn&#x2019;t letting the inn sit empty and become a home for Titus&#x2019;s relatives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;re right. Not many people want to move into a place where a murder happened.&#x201d;</p><p>I shivered all over again for the umpteenth time just thinking about my involvement. Back in May my fudge had been stuck down the throat of an actress who was choked to death. The killer had tried to pin it all on the newbie back in town&#x2014;me. I wondered now if some relative of the murdered woman had bought my cabin in order to be close to her spirit. Was my landlord afraid I&#x2019;d be freaked out? Try to stop the sale?</p><p>But I had more important worries. The First Annual Fishers&#x2019; Harbor Fudge Festival was being held a week from tomorrow&#x2014;Saturday. Back in May I&#x2019;d been conned into sponsoring a fudge contest by my girlfriend&#x2019;s new boyfriend. John Schultz was a tourism and tour promoter out of Milwaukee who looked for any angle to bring himself up to Door County to visit Pauline Mertens. John had convinced me that a fudge contest would help me look like a good business member of the community while making amends for drawing bad karma to Fishers&#x2019; Harbor with the murder involving my fudge. The taste-off next Saturday afternoon would be followed by an adult prom dance in the evening outside the fudge shop on the docks. The prom was also hatched by John, with Pauline&#x2019;s blessing. I couldn&#x2019;t say no to Pauline. She felt sorry for me. I&#x2019;d never been to a prom because as a teenager I was a too-tall, athletic, nerd-farm-girl that the boys passed in the hallway as if I were invisible.</p><p>Unfortunately, things were going wrong. While anybody could enter the fudge contest, John had created a celebrity panel consisting of me and two chefs to draw publicity to the fudge festival. His guest celebrity chef contestants, who had arrived this past Monday for a two-week stay, had taken over the six copper kettles in my shop&#x2014;as in not sharing them with me at all. And I couldn&#x2019;t seem to come up with a new fudge flavor that would knock everybody&#x2019;s socks off. What&#x2019;s more, I had to find or make a prom dress&#x2014;something that wouldn&#x2019;t reveal how much fudge I&#x2019;d eaten in the past couple of months. My excited and desperate friends Pauline and Laura Rousseau were coming over later this morning with yet another set of fabric swatches and dress patterns. Laura was two weeks away from delivering twins and desperate to fill her time after the doctor told her to quit her job.</p><p>Rapid-fire knocking on my front door was followed by my young, red-haired shop assistant, Cody Fjelstad, yelling through the screen, &#x201c;Miss Oosterling! Come quick!&#x201d;</p><p>My mother was with him. She hollered from behind Cody, &#x201c;Ava honey, your shop&#x2019;s being destroyed!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; The nonsensical news kept me rooted for just a second on the floor.</p><p>Cody opened the screen door, then waved frantically. &#x201c;Get a move on, Miss Oosterling. Your chefs are chasing each other around the shop with fudge cutters. They keep saying they&#x2019;re going to kill each other.&#x201d;</p><p>* * *</p><p>My fudge shop and all my freshly made fudge were being held hostage by two chefs with circular knives.</p><p>When I rushed in through the back door of my shop, Kelsey King, a petite blonde from Portland, Oregon, and Piers Molinsky, a portly giant from Chicago, were wielding fudge cutters from their stances on both ends of my white, marble-slab table. My freshly made Cinderella Pink Fudge lay hostage in its pans between them. Kelsey and Piers had fudge cutters poised over the pans.</p><p>Fudge cutters look like pizza cutters&#x2014;round, sharp disks. Kelsey held up a cutter with one disk while Piers had one with multiple disks that could cause a lot of quick damage if tossed at Kelsey.</p><p>I stood in shock behind my old-fashioned cash register, thinking I might need it as protection.</p><p>My mom muttered behind my back, &#x201c;I forgot to tell you about the smell, too.&#x201d;</p><p>The grab bag of aromas in the place made me pause. What had the chefs been up to in only a few minutes&#x2019; time this morning? I&#x2019;d left the place just an hour ago and nobody had been here but my grandpa Gil and a few fishermen. It had smelled of the strong fresh coffee we always had on hand and my new batch of cherry-vanilla pink perfection fudge. Now the bait-and-fudge shop smelled of bacon, of all things, and a heady, earthy mix of spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and maybe some anise and orange peel tossed in.</p><p>I called out from behind my small fortress, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you two? Stop!&#x201d;</p><p>Piers, his chubby face red, his furry brown eyebrows pinched together, kept his gaze lasered on his enemy across the marble table as he picked up a pan of my fudge.</p><p>My heart rate accelerated. &#x201c;Put the fudge down, Piers.&#x201d;</p><p>Piers ignored me, growling at Kelsey, &#x201c;You do not belong in this contest. This is what fudge looks like.&#x201d; He waved my pan of Cinderella Pink Fudge in the air.</p><p>Behind me, my mother whined in panic or disgust or both.</p><p>Kelsey snatched up the other pan of my fudge, waving her fudge cutter over it as she glared at Piers. &#x201c;You see this fudge? This is your face!&#x201d;</p><p>She slashed at my pretty pink fudge.</p><p>My mother screamed, nearly turning me deaf. I gasped, stunned for a moment, waiting for my hearing to come back.</p><p>Cody, whose dream was to be a law officer or park ranger, grabbed one of my four-foot spatulas from a nearby copper kettle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stop &#x2019;em, Miss Oosterling.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Ranger, don&#x2019;t. Stand back.&#x201d; Cody liked being called &#x201c;Ranger,&#x201d; especially after he had helped me solve the murder in May and our county sheriff had awarded him a good-citizenship star. Cody was eighteen and had a mild form of Asperger&#x2019;s. He was making remarkable progress toward independent living with the help of a social worker friend of mine.</p><p>I could&#x2019;ve used the sheriff&#x2019;s help at the moment. Ordinarily, my popular pink fudge sat in front of the big bay window to cure and to entice tourists. Now there was nobody waiting, just the view of Lake Michigan lapping up against the boats rocking at their moorings. Any customers there to buy fudge or bait had scattered to save their lives. Even if I called Sheriff Tollefson or a deputy, the sheriff&#x2019;s office was a half hour&#x2019;s drive away in Sturgeon Bay.</p><p>I glanced to the bait-shop side of the place. &#x201c;Gilpa?&#x201d; The word came out strangled in my tight throat. Since a little girl I&#x2019;d called Grandpa Gil the shortcut name of &#x201c;Gilpa.&#x201d;</p><p>Ranger said, &#x201c;He took a fisherman out just as I got here.&#x201d;</p><p>I appealed again to the chefs. &#x201c;This is silly. It&#x2019;s going to be a beautiful day. Why start it out with a fight?&#x201d;</p><p>Neither looked at me. Instead, they started a volley of words while shaking the fudge cutters and my fudge all about in the air. The glass in the bay window within inches of them was vibrating from the intensity.</p><p>I hesitated going over to the two on my own. Kelsey&#x2019;s blond cuteness and petite frame rendered her deceivingly harmless-looking. But she was a fitness guru who ran a health spa. She knew karate and ate the bark off trees. I was probably smelling bark cooking in the aromas floating about us. Piers, whose bulk reflected his love of the muffin tops he&#x2019;d made famous in Chicago, growled like a bear at Kelsey.</p><p>Piers used his fudge cutter to gouge out and flick a good-sized portion of my precious pink confection onto the floor. He smashed it with the heel of one boot. &#x201c;This is your face.&#x201d;</p><p>We all cried out in pain&#x2014;me, Cody, my mom, and two customers who popped up from behind a shelving unit filled with handmade Cinderella Pink dolls, purses, and teacups. I recognized the ladies from my grandmother&#x2019;s church group. They rushed out, screaming something about &#x201c;saints and sinners.&#x201d; The cowbell on the door clanged. A teacup fell to the floor in their wake and broke.</p><p>Those ladies would spread the gossip fast, so I had to take action. I used the weapon that always worked. &#x201c;There could be TV cameras on you right now for all you know. I think that&#x2019;s John coming down the docks right now.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother whimpered, &#x201c;Oh no.&#x201d;</p><p>John Schultz had been videotaping us every spare moment of his time. To keep things manageable for his videotaping, John wanted just three celebrity contestants&#x2014;me and these two trying to kill one another. He&#x2019;d scoured his universe of contacts in the travel industry and come up with Piers and Kelsey. I&#x2019;m sad to say I approved them. Shows my talent for judging people. John had insisted that he tape the fudge contest activities this week and the next, with the hopes of ending up on a cable channel. He&#x2019;d get a show of his own, he said, and I&#x2019;d get fudge fame. But John wasn&#x2019;t coming down the docks right now; I&#x2019;d lied.</p><p>Fortunately, my lie worked like a hose on two fighting cats. Kelsey broke into tears, dropping her fudge cutter on the marble slab. She looked around for the camera on her. It was pitiful. I almost wished John were here. Piers whipped off his white apron, then used it to swab my ruined pink fudge off the floor. He, too, looked about for the camera, smiling, which g...</p></p><h2>The Hubble Wars: Astrophysics Meets Astropolitics in the Two-Billion-Dollar Struggle over the Hubble Space Telescope</h2><p>One of the senior scientists who worked on the Hubble Telescope recounts in detail the three-way struggle between science, government, and industry that led to the malfunctioning, multibillion dollar project</p><p>A thrilling look inside the Hubble telescope debacle that "may be the most readable and instructive book on the doing of science since James Watson wrote The Double Helix in 1968."--<i>New York Times Book Review</i>The Hubble Space Telescope is the largest, most complex, and most powerful observatory ever deployed in space, designed to allow astronomers to look far back into our own cosmic past with unprecedented clarity. Yet from its launch in 1990, when it was discovered that a flawed mirror was causing severe &#34;myopia&#34; and sending fuzzy images back to Earth, the HST has been at the center of a controversy over who was at fault for the flaw and how it should be fixed. Chaisson, a former senior scientist on the HST project, tells the inside story of the much heralded mission to fix the telescope. Drawing on his journals, Chaisson recreates the day-to-day struggles of scientists, politicians, and publicists to fix the telescope and control the political spin. Illustrated with &#34;before and after&#34; full-color pictures from the telescope and updated with a new Preface, The Hubble Wars tells a tale of scientific comedy, error, and triumph. In this new edition, coming at the half-way point in the HST&#39;s planned mission of fifteen years, Chaisson has brought the Hubble story up-to-date by sorting out the spectacular from the mundane contributions the HST has made to our knowledge of the Solar System, the Milky Way Galaxy, and the distant galaxies of deep space.</p><h2>Dane: Lords of Satyr (The Lords of Satyr)</h2><p>The dark sensuality of the Lords of Satyr returns to 1880s Italy, where these powerful men indulge their lust without inhibition. . .<br><br><b>An Appetite For Pleasure</b><br><br>When Dane Satyr approaches Eva for her services as a matchmaker, she offers him more than just introductions.

His portraits of the fashionable were the rage in Regency London. From 1785 he became First Painter to the Prince of Wales - the only artist ever to have been accorded such a title. He and his wife Maria entertained everybody who was anybody. Herself a talented artist in her own right, she was also a composer, musician and authority on girls&#39; education. Thomas Jefferson fell in love with her; Napoleon doted on her. And yet, save for Richard Cosway&#39;s pre-eminence as a miniaturist, he and Maria have long been neglected by the public, their reputation tarnished by rumour and misrepresentation. Here, Gerald Barnett seeks to present them in a truer and clearer light, emphasising their achievements as artists and individuals and rehabilitating them as major figures in the artistic history of eighteenth-century England. Richard Cosway was the subject of major exhibitions at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery (Edinburgh) and the National Portrait Gallery (London) from August 1995. Richard and Maria Cosway feature prominently as characters in the Merchant-Ivory film Jefferson in Paris.</p><p>Gerald Barnett was born in Exeter and spent much of his life serving in the Royal Navy. Now retired, Commander Barnett has long been an enthusiastic collector of English portrait miniatures and drawings and has been a champion of the Cosways&#39; reputation for much of the past 20 years.</p><h2>The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain, 1649-1815</h2><p><p><strong>An <em>Economist</em> Best Book of 2004: "Destined to remain the reference on the subject for the coming generations."&#x2015;U.S. Naval Institute</strong></p><em>The Command of the Ocean</em> describes with unprecedented authority and scholarship the rise of Britain to naval greatness, and the central place of the Navy and naval activity in the life of the nation and government.

Rodger's comparative view of other navies&#x2015;French, Dutch, Spanish, and American&#x2015;allows him to make a fresh assessment of the qualities of the British. 24 pages of illustrations</p><p>N. A. M. Rodger is professor of naval history at Exeter University and a fellow of the British Academy. He is the author of The Wooden World and the highly acclaimed volumes of his naval history of Britain, The Safeguard of the Sea and The Command of the Ocean. He lives in England.Starred Review. The adjective "magisterial" is justified for this colossal second volume of a complete history of British sea power, which began with <i>The Safeguard of the Sea </i>(1998); the author of the classic 18th-century British naval history, <i>The Wooden World</i>, has surpassed himself here. The book opens with the establishment of the Commonwealth in 1649; for its duration there were two British navies, the Commonwealth Navy (which laid the foundations for a professional officer corps and fought the First Dutch War of 1652&#x2013;1654) and a semipiratical Royalist Navy-in-Exile. After the Restoration, we quickly find the diarist Samuel Pepys exercising less literary but more permanent influence as secretary (or chief administrative officer) of the admiralty. The book offers colossal amounts of information (organized sometimes thematically, sometimes chronologically) right through to its endpoint of 1815, accompanied by a formidable set of notes and bibliography, as well as 24 pages of illustrations. The author not only avoids a hagiography of famous admirals but displays psychological insight in his portraits of, for example, the trio of Lord St. Vincent, his prot�g� Nelson and Nelson's indispensable second, Collingwood. Rodger also demonstrates a firm grasp of the relationship of technical subjects (the amount of tar caulking a ship needed) to British strategy (keeping the Baltic sources of tar accessible). Readers without an intense interest in the subject may be daunted; readers without some background knowledge in British social history may be somewhat at sea in the author's discussion of the officer corps and the recruitment of sailors (usually through the press-gang). Serious students of naval history, however, will find this absolutely indispensable; this is <i>the</i> place to find out whence the navy of Jack Aubrey and Horatio Hornblower came. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Finished only weeks before his death in 1994, it is the self-portrait of one of this century's most original and influential intellectuals.<br><br>Trained in physics and astronomy, Feyerabend was best known as a philosopher of science. But he emphatically was not a builder of theories or a writer of rules. Rather, his fame was in powerful, plain-spoken critiques of "big" science and "big" philosophy. Feyerabend gave voice to a radically democratic "epistemological anarchism:" he argued forcefully that there is not one way to knowledge, but many principled paths; not one truth or one rationality but different, competing pictures of the workings of the world. "Anything goes," he said about the ways of science in his most famous book, <i>Against Method.</i> And he meant it.<br><br>Here, for the first time, Feyerabend traces the trajectory that led him from an isolated, lower-middle-class childhood in Vienna to the height of international academic success. He writes of his experience in the German army on the Russian front, where three bullets left him crippled, impotent, and in lifelong pain. He recalls his promising talent as an operatic tenor (a lifelong passion), his encounters with everyone from Martin Buber to Bertolt Brecht, innumerable love affairs, four marriages, and a career so rich he once held tenured positions at four universities at the same time.<br><br>Although not written as an intellectual autobiography, <i>Killing Time</i> sketches the people, ideas, and conflicts of sixty years. Feyerabend writes frankly of complicated relationships with his mentor Karl Popper and his friend and frequent opponent Imre Lakatos, and his reactions to a growing reputation as the "worst enemy of science."</p><p>If you view the Philosophy professor as a stodgy old curmudgeon wrapped up in theories, and forever spouting eminently sensible nonsense, Paul Feyerabend&#39;s autobiography may change your view. Then again, it may not, because he held the same view himself. Iconoclast, non-conformist and brilliant philosopher, Feyerabend reveals his roots through unadorned, journalist-style prose -- his childhood in Vienna, his aspirations to sing opera, his stint in World War II as a German soldier, his time with Popper in London, his love affairs, marriage and even a little philosophy for good measure.Killing Time is the story of an extraordinary life. Finished only weeks before Paul Feyerabend&#39;s death, it is the self-portrait of one of this century&#39;s most original and influential intellectuals. Trained in physics and astronomy, Feyerabend was best known as a philosopher of science. But he emphatically was not a builder of theories or a writer of rules. Rather, his fame was in powerful, plain-spoken critiques of &#34;big&#34; science and &#34;big&#34; philosophy. In landmark essays and books, and in legendary lectures delivered from Berlin to Berkeley, Feyerabend gave voice to a radically democratic &#34;epistemological anarchism&#34;: he argued forcefully that there is not one way to knowledge but many principled paths; not one truth or one rationality but different, competing pictures of the workings of the world. &#34;Anything goes&#34;, he said about the ways of science in his most famous book, Against Method. And he meant it. Yet few know much about the private life of this most public of intellectuals. For the first time, Feyerabend traces his trajectory from a lower-middle-class childhood in Vienna to the height of international academic success. He writes compellingly and with extraordinary honesty of living through Nazism and his experience in the German army on the Russian front, where three bullets left him crippled, impotent, and in lifelong pain. He recalls his promising talent as an operatic tenor (an enduring passion), his encounters with everyone from Ludwig Wittgenstein to Bertolt Brecht, innumerable love affairs, four marriages, and a career so rich he once held tenured positions at four universities at the same time. Although not written as an intellectual autobiography, Killing Time chroniclesthe people, ideas, and conflicts of sixty years. Feyerabend writes frankly of complicated relationships with his mentor Karl Popper and his friend and frequent opponent Imre Lakatos, and his reactions to a growing reputation as the &#34;worst enemy of science&#34;. He is characteristically self-critical and matter-of-fact, whether about the controversy he regularly provoked or the doubts he had about his own ideas. &#34;I never &#39;denigrated&#39; reason, whatever that is&#34;, he writes, &#34;only some petrified and tyrannical version of it. Nor did I assume my critique was the end of the matter&#34;. Feyerabend&#39;s legacy is immense: the sea change in the way we understand science would have been impossible without him. Contentious, often unforgiving, Feyerabend here is also reflective, even lyrical about the pleasures of philosophy and his love for Grazia Borrini, with whom he shared the last decade of his life. Rarely has an intellectual of this stature told his story with such openness, honesty, or joy.</p><h2>Thomas Jefferson: A Life</h2><p>Marking the 250th anniversary of Thomas Jefferson&#39;s birth, a new biography of the great founding father presents Jefferson as a dynamic &#34;modern&#34; man who was thoroughly influenced by the philosophical movements of his time.

Jefferson operated on two levels, as his opposition to slavery as a slaveowner attests. But as Willard Sterne Randall argues, this duality is what made him so effective. Whether Jefferson&#39;s 1784 draft of Virginia&#39;s constitution &#34;prefigured the founding documents of republics in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, as well as the Confederate States of America,&#34; as Randall claims, is questionable, but his impact on international trade, diplomatic discussions and the success of the state of Virginia cannot be disputed.<p>Willard Sterne Randall is the prize-winning author of thirteen books, including <em>Ethan Allen: His Life and Times; A Little Revenge: Benjamin Franklin at War with His Son; Thomas Jefferson: A Life; George Washington: A Life; and Benedict Arnold: Patriot and Traitor.</em> A finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, he is a professor of history at Champlain College and lives in Burlington, Vermont.</p></p><h2>A Christmas Wish (Linden Corners)</h2><p><b>This Christmas, the greatest gifts can't be found beneath a tree. . .</b><br><br>Eight-year-old Janey Sullivan has had a difficult year, between losing her mother and adjusting to life with her guardian, Brian Duncan.

Reissue.</p><p>Paul Dickson is the author of more than 40 books on diverse topics, including two works of investigative journalism.October 4, 1957, was my tenth birthday. Long after the festivities, I was in bed, snuggled under my Roy Rogers bedspread and enjoying my best present--a new transistor radio in a snappy leather case. This was a clandestine operation since I had been ordered to go to sleep hours ago. The radio, under the cover of Roy, was playing softly as I scanned the dial. Rather than the rock 'n' roll I sought, what I heard was the excited voice of a newscaster discussing something called Sputnik, a Russian satellite that had just been launched and, judging by the newscaster's agitated tone, should be a cause of great concern to everyone.<p>At this point, my knowledge of the Russians was a bit sketchy. I knew, of course, that they were the bad guys, responsible for making me practice hiding under my desk to ward off fallout in the event of a nuclear attack. I knew, too, that the Russians were supposed to be very smart and very tough. I knew this because my uncle often chided my cousin and I for our lag-about ways by telling us that someday we were going to have to fight the Russians, and he--a veteran of the European theater in World War II--happened to know that they were "smart, tough sons of bitches." His prediction seemed to be coming true on my tenth birthday. I hadn't expected to be forced to fight the Russians quite so soon, and I certainly hadn't expected to contend with missiles fired from the moon (which the newscaster was saying would be the inevitable next step, after Sputnik). I didn't yet know how to spell Sputnik, but I did know it was big trouble.</p><p>In the following days and weeks, I quickly realized that I wasn't the only one worried about the Russians and their satellites, but somehow I never lost the notion that the first Sputnik belonged to me. In some part of my mind, I think I assumed that I was the first private citizen in the U.S. to hear the news. Who else would be up in the middle of the night listening to the radio? (In fact, the launch had occurred some hours before I heard about it, but it was inconceivable to me that anything newsworthy might have taken place during my birthday party.) So even as the decades rolled by, as the word Sputnik first became a part of popular culture and then receded from center stage, I continued to nod quietly to myself every time I heard the name, secure in the belief that, although everyone claimed a knowledge of Sputnik, I had a special, even secret, relationship with it.</p><p>About 20 years ago, when I happened to interview Stephen King, I had my first inkling that I might have to share a little bit of Sputnik. It turns out that King was also celebrating his tenth birthday in the fall of 1957 (on September 21, just a few days before the launch) and was also shaken by the idea of the Russians in space--so much so that he contends to this day that Sputnik was a key factor in his becoming a writer of horror fiction. Well, maybe so, but he wasn't born on October 4, and he didn't have a Roy Rogers bedspread. </p><p>After reading Paul Dickson's fascinating Sputnik: The Shock of the Century, I'm afraid my illusions are shattered once and for all. Sputnik was a slut, a tramp, and she enjoyed special relationships with virtually the entire population of the U.S. alive on October 4, 1957. Dickson has all the details: the Stephen King story is there, but that's just the beginning. Little Richard was so shocked by the appearance of Sputnik in the sky as he was performing an outdoor concert that he renounced rock 'n' roll (temporarily) and became a preacher. Ross Perot was inspired by Sputnik to create an electronics dynasty. And countless other Americans, great and small, remember the launch of Sputnik as a turning point in their lives. Damn.</p><p>As disappointed as I was to read of Sputnik's infidelity, I was also caught up in the scientific and social history surrounding the satellite's creation and its aftermath. Dickson makes the space race come alive in layman's language, and he shows how the shock of the Russians being first at something galvanized this country in all sorts of far-reaching ways. Who would have thought, for example, that Sputnik was responsible for the Summer of Love? Here's how it worked: Sputnik proved the Russians were doing a better job than we were at education, prompting the National Defense Education Act, which stressed science but also advocated creative and independent thought. A generation removed from Sputnik, young people wearied of science but used their NDEA-funded independent thinking skills to challenge the establishment on everything from civil rights and Vietnam to long hair and free love. That Sputnik was some satellite--but I've known that for 44 years. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The razor-edged sawgrass of the Everglades makes a wonderful setting for Blake as his hero, young John Ashley, soon to become a legendary bootlegger and killer, duly takes care of business. Young Ashley poles into the swamp to deliver homemade hooch to DeSoto Tiger, an Indian buddy, when drunken, bowler-hatted DeSoto draws his knife and gets shot thrice by the lad. Eventually, Johns arrested by his nemesis, Sheriff Bobby Baker (the two became rivals long before, when John seduced Bobbys girl)but he manages to escape. John disappears for two years, becoming a bouncer in a New Orleans whorehouse, then resurfaces, walking into Sheriff Baker's office with his father and a lawyer. Bobby taunts John that he'll hang, but John again wiggles loose. Prohibition arrives; the moonshine business blooms. John's arrested again during a bank robbery; Bobby Baker thumbs out one of his eyes; brown-eyed John, sporting one blue glass eye, escapes from a road gang, goes back to bank-robbingand comes up against the Chicago mob that tries to muscle in on his Florida territory. He also finds himself caught between his ever-loving young blind whore, Loretta May, and swamp-girl Laura Upthegrove. John is captured yet again, and yet again escapes lockup, this time with his Ashley Gang. Now Bobby Baker's feeling truly vengeful . . . . Sex and drawlin' dialogue that don't give a damn about real English, along with big whiffs of piney-fresh description, gusts of gunfire, and howling action like a night in a cathouse during a hurricane.

They, like grandfather of Communism Georg Hegel, argue that government is Divinely sanctioned to do anything it pleases and that God requires people to submit regardless of God&#39;s standards of justice. This argument has been used by virtually every tyrant since Jesus, including Adolf Hitler.Romans 13: The True Meaning of Submission shows with overwhelming evidence that submission to government is limited and that the obey-government-no-matter-what argument is false! It discusses sound rules of interpretation and construction, incorporates biblical reasoning, and uses hundreds of Scriptural proofs for its conclusions.Perhaps more than any other resource, Romans 13: The True Meaning of Submission will help you achieve a much greater and deeper understanding of and appreciation for the Biblical teaching regarding a person&#39;s duty of submission and relationship towards government. There is hardly a subject today more needed in political, philosophical, and theological studies.Content and Preview:ForewordPrefaceIntroductionCh 1: Submission Command Applies to Every Soul-A Universal PrincipleCh 2: De Facto &#39;Higher Powers&#39; Superseded by De Jure &#39;Highest Powers&#39;Ch 3: &#39;Higher Powers&#39; Are God-Ordained To Apply JusticeCh 4: That God Commands Unlimited Submission to Unjust Government Contradicts God&#39;s NatureCh 5: &#39;Higher Powers&#39; Qualify as Ministers of God by Merit of Works-Not Mere Title or PositionCh 6: &#39;Higher Powers&#39; Ordained Only For the Good of the PeopleCh 7: God Is No Respecter of &#39;Higher Powers&#39;Ch 8: Submission Must Consider One&#39;s ConscienceCh 9: Submission Must Consider One&#39;s Duties to OthersCh 10: Proper Submission May Require Reformation or ResistanceEndnotes</p><p></p><h2>Lake Huron Rock Picker&#39;s Guide</h2><p><p>Bruce Mueller is owner of the C&amp;M Rock Shop in Honor, Michigan.

Fortunately, as this vibrant guide so elegantly shows, the craft is both easy and enjoyable to explore and requires no special equipment: just ordinary pots and pans. A thoroughly illustrated tutorial covers all the basics of hot and cool dyeing, and 30 colorful options to try, including roots and plants (madder, tumeric, henna), wood (cutch, fustic), flowers (safflower, dandelion, daffodil), leaves and stalks (tea, rhubarb, indigo), and fruits and vegetables (blackberry, wild cherry, avocado). From pale pinks and vibrant oranges to earthy browns and rich blues, a vast spectrum of hues awaits.</p><p>Jackie Crook is an experimental dyer, who grows her own natural dyes and has been practising dyeing for 20 years.

Examining the basic assumptions of his profession, psychotherapist Storr argues that the essential goal of man is self-realization, the drive toward maturity that is inextricably linked with "the development of his relationship with others," and that the purpose of psychotherapy is to further that development in collaboration with the therapist. Although his own training is Jungian, Storr is remarkably candid in conceding that Freudian and Kleinian analysts achieve roughly the same degree of success. But too much of the book is given over to unstartling pronouncements, such as his proclamation that immature parents generally raise immature children, or to dry reiteration of post-Freudian commonplaces. Moreover, Storr's analysis of homosexuality as "a failure of maturation" has long since been superseded by other views. The same might be said of some of his observations about the etiology of schizophrenia. Finally, although the introductory chapters are lucid and crisp, the bulk of the book is written in an academic style that wears out its welcome in a few pages. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2><p>Used, but in like new condition!

More than 100,000 fans were jammed inside Michigan Stadium, on their feet, to witness a heated football rivalry that had spanned more than 100 years. As the football was kicked into the snow-filled sky, they were about to get the shock of their lives, as long-foretold Bible prophecy came to pass before their very eyes, causing many to vanish into thin air without a trace.But what they soon realized was that it reached far beyond Michigan Stadium.

But how are Christians supposed to discern what lessons from history need to be learned?<br> <br> In this small but thoughtful volume, respected theologian and churchman Rowan Williams opens up a theological approach to history, an approach that is both nonpartisan and relevant to the church's present needs. As he reflects on how we consider the past in general, Williams suggests that how we consider church history in particular remains important not so much for winning arguments as for clarifying who we are as time-bound human beings. Good history is a moral affair, he advises, because it opens up a point of reference that is distinct from us yet not wholly alien. The past can then enable us to think with more varied and resourceful analogies about our identity in the often confusing present.</p><p>Rowan Williams was Archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012, and is now Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge."Good historical writing constructs our sense of who we are by a real engagement with the strangeness of the past. . . . Bad history is any kind of narrative that refuses this difficulty and enlargement &#x2014; whether by giving us a version of the past that is just the present in fancy dress or by dismissing the past as a wholly foreign country whose language we shall never learn."</p><h2>Books that Saved My Life: Reading For Wisdom, Solace, and Pleasure</h2><p><p>Here are forty texts to read at some stage in your life: forty texts that can enrich you in all manner of ways.

Rozan now owns a coveted Anthony Award for Best Novel for her <i>No Colder Place</i>. The <i>Washington Post</i> has called her Bill Smith/Lydia Chin novels...a series to watch for....Booklist deemed Rozan....a major figure in contemporary mystery fiction...Now it's your turn--to discover one of fiction's major voices and to fall in love with a mystery of evocative atmosphere, engaging characters, and exquisite writing. <br><br>It's Lydia Chin's turn to go underground as the Chinese-American P.I. investigates a case that strikes at the heart of Chinatown's dangerously shifting power structure. Four restaurant workers, including a union organizer, have disappeared, and the union's lawyer hires Lydia to find them. But when a bomb shatters the Chinese Restaurant Workers' Union headquarters, killing one of the missing men and injuring the lawyer, Lydia is summoned by the prime suspect, one of Chinatown's most powerful men, to continue the search--on his payroll. With backup from her partner Bill Smith, Lydia goes undercover as a dim sum waitress, slinging steamed dumplings while dodging a lethal conflict between the old and the new orders, and searching for the missing waiters and their deadly secret--before someone serves them their last supper<br></p><p>There's lots of action, great food, and social insight into the attitudes of various generations of immigrants in S.J. Rozan's fifth book in her superlative Lydia Chin-Bill Smith series. There's also a remarkable moment when Lydia's mother actually admits that she approves of the way her daughter does her job. Mrs. Chin has always hated the fact that Lydia's work as a private detective puts her in danger and in the company of men, like Smith, who don't make suitable husbands. But when Lydia refuses to knuckle under to the demands of a venerable Chinatown patriarch, her mother astonishes her (and us) by praising her "professional manner"--and then goes on to give her a clue that helps her unravel a mystery involving the smuggling of people and drugs. With each novel, Rozan alternates the narrative focus between Lydia Chin and Bill Smith, and this time it's Lydia's turn to take center stage. She uses her ethnicity and acting talent to work undercover as a dim sum waitress at the Dragon Garden (where four illegal aliens have disappeared) and her deep roots in New York's Chinatown to note and comment on subtle changes in the power structure as new Fukienese-speaking immigrants replace the old Cantonese. She and Smith also move their complicated personal relationship forward a notch and consume vast amounts of wonderful food--Chinese, Jewish, even a homemade meatloaf--in a story that manages to satisify all the senses.

By drawing on the Buddhist psychological teachings, Contemplative Psychotherapy provides a deeper, richer approach to client work, one that can greatly enhance and expand a clinician&#x2019;s therapeutic repertoire.<br><br> While much has been written recently about mindfulness in psychotherapy and the underlying theory of Buddhist psychology, no book has yet been written that explains to therapists how to apply these teachings in their day-to-day clinical work with clients.<br><br> This book will answer that need.<br><br> Karen Kissel Wegela, a leading practitioner and teacher of contemplative psychotherapy, eloquently walks readers through the foundational concepts of this approach and its specific clinical practices, providing lucid guidance on what Buddhist psychology means in the context of therapy work and how to practice it.<br><br> As Wegela explains, five basic competencies underlie all that a contemplative therapist does: (1) being present and letting be, (2) seeing clearly and not judging, (3) recognizing and appreciating differences, (4) connecting with others and cultivating relationship, and, finally, (5) acting skillfully and letting go. Having a personal mindfulness-awareness practice helps therapists to develop these competencies, and this book offers a step-by-step description of how to establish such a practice.<br><br> The book explores the nuances of contemplative therapy practice, beginning with creating genuine therapeutic relationships and learning how to recognize &#x201c;brilliant sanity&#x201d;&#x2015;not only psychopathology&#x2015;in our clients, and goes on to consider sowing the seeds of mindfulness, making skillful use of mindlessness practices, investigating emotions, cultivating compassion, and working with anger.<br><br> Filled with client vignettes and practical guidance in an eminently wise, openhearted tone, <em>Contemplative Psychotherapy Essentials</em> makes the increasingly popular pairing of Buddhist psychology with traditional therapy accessible for any clinician, putting readers and their clients in better touch with the present moment&#x2015;their bodies, emotions, and minds&#x2015;for more enduring change.</p><p>Karen Kissel Wegela, PhD, is an author, private practitioner, and professor at Naropa University.

A distinguished semifinalist for OSU&#x2019;s 2016 Non/Fiction Collection Prize, De Facto... is a cross between Audre Lorde's Zami: A New Spelling of My Name and Jean Toomer's Cane, blending essay, poems, graphics and literary criticism. An act of self-definition spanning four decades, the central person in DeFacto... is the writer herself, a feminist foot soldier. With the feel of memoir, these essays align with female thinkers Anna Julia Cooper, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Lorde, Alice Walker, Michelle Wallace, Angela Davis, bell hooks, Paula Giddings, Michelle Alexander, Roxane Gay and Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche. Much like the central character in her semi-autobiographical novel, Virgin Soul, whom Juanita calls a female foot soldier, the voice herein is a feminist foot soldier, processing major shifts in American society through the portal of her own artistic development. The essays are set chronologically, beginning with a picture of her Tuskegee Airman father, and an account of a not altogether idyllic childhood in Oakland, California. A patchwork narrative emerges: Growing up in Oakland in the fifties and sixties. Comparing her burgeoning sexuality to young white females in 1964 having orgiastic responses to the Beatles. Formulating an erstwhile womanhood based on Black Nationalism. Deconstructing the infamous N-word controversy. Looking back acerbically at her romance with The Gun and the black power movement. Paying homage to Black Arts Movement poet Carolyn M. Rodgers. Celebrating 21st century feminism in unexpected places. Examining race and micro-aggression in liberal Berkeley. Living with a ghost/mentor for a year. The book's format moves from essay to poem to epistle, utilizing the genre of letter writing in the final essay, &#x201c;Acknowledge Me,&#x201d; a true ghost story in which a dead playwright, once her teacher, pushes her to succeed. &#x201c;Whatever Happened to Carolyn M. Rodgers?&#x201d; pays homage to a poet who became a phantom of the Black Arts Movement (BAM). Rodgers utilized the militancy of the era to draw attention to larger social issues. She mixed slang, nostalgia, curse words, sociology, raw revelation of sexual intimacies to address the abyss between black men and women; she became a near pariah for reviving her Christian faith. &#x201c;Report from the Front&#x201d; indicates how America&#x2019;s most liberal city still channels racism. &#x201c;De Facto Feminism&#x201d; tallies the ways feminism finds its way in a country that counts black women out, from fighting/finding contingency, building bridges, breaking bread, doing bizness the old fashioned way, and myriad other examples. &#x201c;Cleaning Other People&#x2019;s Houses&#x201d; considers the value of physical labor as the author works as a domestic for a living; Juanita leaves that job remembering that Zora Neale Hurston worked as a domestic in the last impoverished decade of her life. In the wake of Trayvon Martin, &#x201c;The Gun as Ultimate Performance Poem&#x201d; looks at the gun&#x2019;s power and role in the African American community from the Panthers to the present. &#x201c;Five Comrades in The Black Panther Party, 1967-1970&#x201d; is the author&#x2019;s recollection on joining the Black Panthers and revisiting the movement some 40 years later. &#x201c;All The Women in My Family Read Terry McMillan&#x201d; finds the newly minted novelist asking what to do about black literature, as she finds that it doesn&#x2019;t quite fit with the chick lit and black chick-lit books her friends and family are reading. &#x201c;Putting the Funny in the Novel&#x201d; was written after her agent said her novel (about the Black Panthers) wasn&#x2019;t funny enough. Juanita learned standup and lived to tell the tale (and jokes). &#x201c;The N-Word.&#x201d; In an age of trigger warnings and multiple N-Word explosions, Juanita blasts its premature burial...with qualifications, considerations &#x2013; and calling it on white cops.</p><p>Judy Juanita wrote the essays at the heart of<i> De Facto Feminism: Essays Straight Outta Oakland </i>while a contributing editor to <i>The Weeklings</i>. In total, all fifteen essays form a portrait of the artist as a black woman moving from youthful activism to maturity. <i>De Facto.</i>.. has many cultural references to Juanita's native California.<br><br>Judy Juanita's debut novel published by Viking (2013) is <i>Virgin Soul</i>, based on her own experiences in the black power movement in the 60s. Born in Berkeley and raised in Oakland, 16-year-old Judie Hart enrolled at Oakland City College where she first met fellow students Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. As a junior at San Francisco State, she joined the Black Student Union and met up with Huey and Bobby again. She joined and began working full-time for the Black Panther Party (BPP). When Eldridge Cleaver was jailed after the 1968 shootout in West Oakland, Huey appointed her editor-in-chief of the BPP Intercommunal News Service. <br><br>She worked on the newspaper and the BPP Breakfast for Children program while finishing her BA at SF State. With fellow Black Student Union and Third World Liberation Front activists, she participated in the nation's longest student strike, 4-1/2 months - that established open enrollment and ethnic studies, changing the face of American higher education. In 1969, she became the youngest faculty member of the nation's first black studies program at SF State.<br><br>Her poetry and fiction have appeared in <i>13th Moon, Painted Bride Quarterly, Lips, Crab Orchard Review, Croton Review </i>and <i>Obsidian II</i>, and her plays have been produced in the Bay Area and NYC.While living in New Jersey, Juanita was awarded New Jersey Arts Council Fellowships and worked as Poet-in-the-Schools. She received an MFA in creative writing from San Francisco State University in 1993 and has taught writing at Laney College in Oakland since 1993.In <i>De Facto Feminism</i>,Judy Juanita celebrates the <i>working class</i>black individualist...by showing the (oft-unheralded) ways they help buildcommunity, not through theoretical imperative, but simply in order to survive.The women Juanita celebrates transcend the false "binary thinking dilemmas"(between artist and activist, and between individualist and collectivist) toengage in an artistic activism, and an altruism that need not beself-abnegating and that occupies a fertile, proliferative place where selfishnessand altruism, individualism and community activism can unite. For sometimes thereason why one doesn't "fit in" to one social scene is the same reason you canget along with more people from <i>other</i> socialscenes.<br>&nbsp;<br>During her time with the Black Panthers, which in hindsight she calls her phaseof "naively determined black womanhood," Juanita had been an idealisticanti-individualist collectivist (In "Black Womanhood," an essay Juanita wroteat the age of 20 for the <i>Black Panther Newspaper</i>,she writes that the struggle requires "her strength, not her will, herleadership, her domination, but her strength"). But, it must not be forgottenthat Juanita, even as a young woman, was not just a Black Panther, but alsopart of the Black Arts Movement (BAM which may not be as well known to the generalreader)[1]:<br><br>In her title essay, she offers her own definition of "defacto feminism" by contrasting it with the 20th century feminism sheexperienced: 20th Century feminism is "defensive, lean-in elite,scarce, historical, white-ish, precious, theoretical, lawful, contempt for menbut not their $$$." De-facto feminism is "offensive, classless, proliferative,a historical, black and then some, inside/outside the law, do you with/withoutmen" (146)....<br><br>Because Juanita published <i>Virgin Soul</i>(2013), in her late 60s, what people used to call one's retirement years (whenone could get away doing that), some may "see" her as a "late bloomer." Yet,what Juanita was doing these years, was not merely honing her craft, but alsoexploring different social dynamics in which art circulates (as she exploresthe social interactions in the theatre world, the stand-up comedy world, andeven the poetry world), and also digesting (if not exactly recoiling from) theextremely intense "baptism by fire" she experienced at age 20 in the BlackPanthers as an agent of change. The years in between are hardly "lost years."Juanita is able to make art out of stint as a maid in "Cleaning Other People'sHouses," in addition to increasing her empathy for the working class women shechampions. In a sense, the essay on Carolyn Rogers may be the most personal, asobviously Juanita can relate to a woman celebrated by the BAM, but laterforgotten as she eschewed the "militant" posture which made it easier to getpublished during this time.<br>&nbsp;<br>In these essays, Juanita emerges as a working class artist/intellectual (whichour dominant culture tries to tell us is an oxymoron), and a working classteacher, one who is highly skeptical of the ready-made solutions, and theridiculous gerrymandered specialized genres. She challenges the social nexusthat too often determines the circulation of literary texts in our society, andyet emerges triumphant. As she speaks of the way she learned to become anovelist, by jumping from many social scenes and roles as artist/intellectual,I see a writer relentlessly measuring the inner world by the outer world, andvice versa." - Chris Stroffolino, <i>Konch Magazine</i><br><br>This extraordinary set of autobiographical essays gives insight into a black woman's life in the arts: everything from joining the Black Panthers to avoiding African-American chick lit.<br>Juanita (Virgin Soul, 2013) grew up in Oakland, California, in the 1950s. She remembers a "goody-goody" childhood of reading, spelling bees, and chores. America at the time was "a Jell-O &amp; white bread land of perfection and gleaming surfaces," she notes in her essay "White Out"; the only blacks on screen played mammies and maids. She joined the Black Panthers at San Francisco State in 1966 and became a junior faculty member in its Black Studies department--the nation's first. In perhaps the most powerful piece in the collection, "The Gun as Ultimate Performance Poem," written after the death of Trayvon Martin, Juanita sensitively discusses the split in the Black Panthers over carrying guns. She liked guns' symbolic associations and even kept one in her purse while working at a post office. But she now recognizes the disastrous consequences of romanticizing a weapon: "It was Art. It was Metaphor. It was loaded with meaning and death." In another standout, "The N-word," she boldly explores the disparate contexts in which the epithet appears: in August Wilson's play Fences, in comedy routines, and intimately between friends. "It's not problem or solution; it's an indication," she concludes. The title essay contends that black women are de facto feminists because they're so often reduced to single parenting in poverty. Elsewhere, she discusses relationships between black men and women, recalls rediscovering poetry as a divorc�e with an 8-year-old son in New Jersey ("Tough Luck," which includes her own poems), remembers a time spent cleaning condos, and remarks that Terry McMillan has ensured that a "black female writer not writing chick lit has an uphill challenge."<br>The author refers to herself as "an observational ironist," and her incisive comments on black life's contradictions make this essay collection a winner. --&nbsp;<i>Kirkus Reviews <em>(starred review)</em></i></p><h2>The Wartime Papers Of Robert E.

Many of the pieces have an experimental quality in that they catch something elemental from an unexplored angle as they venture onto shaky ground. The spiciest take no pains to disguise the process of getting there: Readers share the sensory information coming in and witness the writer&#x2019;s brain decoding and shaping the material, all subjective and unlike any other, making their own local color as both participant and observer and changing their way of being in the world. As a style, creative nonfiction has yet to be thoroughly pinned down; it remains simultaneously furtive and dodgy, versatile and as inclusive as a hug from Walt Whitman. Longtime New Yorker contributor Susan Orlean&#x2014;who better to write the introduction?&#x2014;makes important suggestions to writers considering creative nonfiction: Don&#x2019;t over-prepare. Be willing to jump into stories naked; you&#x2019;ll listen harder and learn more authentically. On the other hand, do over-report.

The <i>Annals of Improbable Research</i> (and its predecessor, the <i>Journal of Irreproducible Results</i>) has been making fun of science and scientists for decades. This latest compendium includes a listing of the Ig Nobel prizes, annually awarded "for scientific achievements which cannot or should not be reproduced," and some of the prizewinning papers, such as "Failure of Electric Shock Treatment for Rattlesnake Envenomation" and "Of Mites and Man." There are also plenty of groundbreaking original studies from <i>AIR</i>: "How Dead Is a Doornail?" "Furniture Airbags," and "The Medical Effects of Kissing Boo-Boos." As the book's warning label states, the result is a highly reactive mix: "Contents are unexpectedly educational and informative, especially in patients who suffer allergic reactions to science, technology, literature, or art. Can be highly addictive."

This book also covers the other forts that defined the Israeli landscape during three centuries of civil strife and war against the Romans.

After describing life in the fortifications in peace and wear, the book focuses on several sieges of Jerusalem and on the epic Roman siegfe of Masada, which remains deeply embedded in the Israeli consciousness.

His two outspoken and best-selling novels, The Hand-Reared Boy and A Solider Erect, established his reputation, which was soon enhanced by a psychedelic novel of European dimensions, Barefoot in the Head. He is also the author of a Gothic adventure, Frankenstein Unbound, a space opera, The Eighty-Minute Hour, a remarkable opus entitled The Malacia Tapestry and an epic extravaganza illustrated by Mike Wilks, Pile. But his fame, built up over many years, is as one of the most innovative, prolific and popular writers of science fiction of our day. His most recent books in this field have been Last Orders and Other Stories; Enemies of the System, which Anthony Burgess described in the Observer as &#39;rich, allusive, full of real people and unfailingly interesting&#39;; New Arrivals, Old Encounters and Moreau&#39;s Other Island.

Ma Huan was the Muslim interpreter of the famous Cheng Ho, commander of the Chinese Fleet. Of the sources for the history of southern Asia during the 15th century, the Chinese authorities are the most rewarding, and of these the most informative and interesting is Ma Huan. The 15th century was the heroic age of Chinese naval expansion; four Chinese fleets traversed the Indian Ocean simultaneously, and flotillas explored &#39;the four seas&#39; from southern Africa to Timor. The imperial court was thronged with royal visitors or envoys from 70 foreign countries from Japan to Hormuz, and Chinese manufactures were sought after in the markets of Asia from Majapahit to Baghdad. This new translation is based on the definitive text established by the eminent Chinese scholar Feng Ch&#39;eng-Chun and first published in 1935. Mr. Mills&#39; introduction contains accounts of Cheng Ho&#39;s expeditions and Ma Huan&#39;s book. Eight appendices treat peripheral topics, mainly geographical and nautical; a gazetteer records the names of some 700 places known to the Chinese when their golden age of exploration ended in 1433; with the aid of printed and manuscript sailing directions, an attempt is made to explain about 600 names and legends in the remarkable maritime cartogram (&#39;Mao K&#39;un Map&#39;) published in the Wu Pei Chih, and to trace the stages of voyages made, inter alia, through the Singapore Strait, from Sumatra to Ceylon (Pieh-lo-li, Beruwala), and from Malacca to China. This text obtains new significance for what is not in it: this classic Chinese text shows no historical evidence to support Chinese claims to the Spratlys.</p><p>Text: English, Chinese (translation)</p><h2>Rose in a Storm: A Novel</h2><p>From <i>New York Times bestselling</i> author Jon Katz comes a moving and powerful novel, the first one inspired by life on his celebrated Bedlam Farm&#x2014;and perceptively told from the point of view of Rose, a dedicated working dog.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rose is determined and focused, keeping the sheep out of danger and protecting the other creatures on the farm she calls home. But of all those she&#x2019;s looked after since coming to the farm as a puppy, it is Sam, the farmer, whom she watches most carefully.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Awoken one cold midwinter night during lambing season, Rose and Sam struggle into the snowy dark to do their work. The ever observant Rose has seen a change in her master of late, ever since Sam&#x2019;s wife disappeared one day. She senses something else in the air as well: A storm is coming, but not like any of the ones she&#x2019;s seen over the years. This storm feels different, bigger, more foreboding.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>When an epic blizzard hits the region, it will take all of Rose&#x2019;s resolve, resourcefulness, and courage to help Sam save the farm and the creatures who live there.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jon Katz consulted with animal behavior scientists to create his unique and convincing vision of the world as seen through the eyes of a dog. Poignant, thrilling, and beautifully wrought, Rose in a Storm is a wonderfully original and powerful tale from a gifted storyteller.</p><p>Jon Katz has written nineteen books&#x2014;seven novels and twelve works of nonfiction&#x2014;including <b>Soul of a Dog, Izzy &amp; Lenore, Dog Days, A Good Dog</b>, and <b>The Dogs of Bedlam Farm</b>. He has written for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Slate, <i>Rolling Stone, Wired</i>, and the <i>AKC Gazette</i>. He has worked for <i>CBS News, The Boston Globe, The Washington Post, </i>and <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i>. Katz is also a photographer and the author of a children&#x2019;s book, <i>Meet the Dogs of Bedlam Farm</i>. He lives on Bedlam Farm in upstate New York with the artist Maria Heinrich; his dogs, Rose, Izzy, Lenore, and Frieda; and his barn cats, Mother and Minnie.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>Inside the farmhouse Rose lifted her head and pricked up her ears. She heard the troubled wheezing of a ewe. From the window, through the dark, she could see mist, mud, and the reddish shadows of the barns. She pictured the herd of sheep lying still, spread out behind the feeder.<br><br>Raising her nose toward the pasture, she smelled the rich, sticky scent of birth, of lamb. She smelled manure and fear.<br><br>She heard a gasp, the sound of death or desperation, and then one ewe calling to the others in alarm. She stood and padded quickly from the window to the side of the farmer&#x2019;s bed, then looked up at his sleeping face. She barked once, insistently and loudly.<br><br>Sam, the farmer, startled awake from a dream of Katie in the dark January night. He muttered, &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; and mumbled something about a night&#x2019;s sleep, but got out of bed, pulling on pants and a shirt.<br><br>He knew better than to ignore Rose, especially at lambing time. She seemed to have a sort of map of the farm inside her head, a picture of how things ought to be. Whenever something was wrong or out of place&#x2014;an animal sick, a fence down, an unwelcome intruder&#x2014;she knew it instantly, and called attention to it, sniffing, barking, circling. She constantly updated the map, it seemed to Sam.<br><br>Occasionally her map failed or confused her&#x2014;but that was rare. Sam saw to it that Rose was always with him, that she was apprised of everything that came and went&#x2014;every animal, every machine&#x2014;so she could keep her mental inventory.<br><br>Among his friends, Sam called Rose his farm manager. They had been together for six years, ever since he had driven over to the Clark farm in Easton and seen a litter of border collie/shepherd mix pups. He had still been debating with himself about whether to get a herding dog&#x2014;he had no idea how to train one, and no time to do it, anyway.<br><br>But, perhaps picking up the scent of sheep, Rose ran right over to him, looking so eager to get to work, even at eight weeks old, that he brought her home. A few weeks after she arrived, some sheep had wandered through an unlatched gate and across the road, and Rose shot out of the house through the newly installed dog door, corralled them, and marched them back, working on instinct alone. She certainly had no help from Sam, who wasn&#x2019;t even aware that the sheep were at liberty. The two had been working side by side ever since.<br><br>From then on, Sam would shake his head whenever he saw the elaborate, highly choreographed herding trials on television. Rose grew into the role on her own; she simply seemed to know what to do. The farm, he told his friends, was the world&#x2019;s greatest trainer. And the sheep did what she told them to, which was all Sam really cared about. Get them from one place to another. Didn&#x2019;t have to be pretty, though sometimes it was beautiful.<br><br>The relationship had grown way beyond anything Sam understood at first, or even imagined. It was more like a partnership, he had told Katie, an understanding subtler than words. It was something he lived, not something he thought much about.<br><br>I think you love that dog more than me, Katie would sometimes joke. Sam would blush and stammer. She&#x2019;s just a dog, he would say, because he could not say what Rose truly meant to him.<br><br>Now he could tell from the urgency of Rose&#x2019;s bark that something was wrong. She kept tilting her ears to the pasture, agitated, eager to get outside.<br><br>So on this cold and windswept night, Sam, a tall, thin man with what had once been a ready smile and a full head of reddish-brown hair, went downstairs and got a flashlight, pulled on a jacket and boots, and he and Rose walked out the back door and into the night. Even in the dark, in the reflected light of the moon, he could see the glow of her fiercely bright-blue eyes.<br><br>The farmhouse sat at the bottom of a gentle, rolling pasture. By the back door, there were two paths. The one to the left led out into the woods, and the one to the right ran toward the two barns and the pasture gates.<br><br>The first barn was big, filled with hay up in the loft and tractors, and sometimes cows, down below. A shed was attached to the big barn, which housed equipment and supplies, as well as some feed. Farther up the hill was a large pole barn. A three-sided structure with the fourth side open to the air, it allowed the sheep to be outside, which they preferred, while still offering some shelter from the elements. When they were kept inside a closed barn, they got fearful, claustrophobic, bleated day and night. Anyway, it was the way Sam&#x2019;s father had done it. The three buildings formed a triangle: the farmhouse at the bottom, the big barn off to one side nearby, the pole barn a hundred yards up the hill. The cows were in the other pasture on the far side of the barn.<br><br>A few hundred feet from the farmhouse, the path led to a gate that connected to a fence encircling all of the pastures and barns. Sam was proud of that fence. He&#x2019;d spent years shoring and patching it, and in the past year or so, no animal had slipped out, or in.<br><br>As they neared the barn, Sam finally saw in the beam of light from his flashlight what Rose had heard and sensed, up behind the building. He moved faster, opening the pasture gate. Rose raced through and ran to the struggling ewe. Sam retrieved his sack of medical equipment from the barn and hurried behind the dog up a path well worn by the animals, marked by manure and ice-encrusted mud, pungent even in winter. The big barn was on the right, looming like a great battleship, its lights sending small beams out into the dark, foggy pasture. That old barn had a lot of stories to tell.<br><br>The lambing shed where Sam had put this pregnant ewe a few days earlier was also open on one side, though protected from the snow and wind. An open hatchway led from the lambing shed inside the barn to an area warmed by heat lamps and lined with hay and straw, where the ewes could take their newborn lambs. With this arrangement, they were outside when they went into labor, so they could be near the other sheep, and Sam could still see and hear them from the house. Or at least Rose could.<br><br>He trained his light on the sick ewe, number 89. Her wheezing had calmed, which was an ominous sign, and she lay still, on her side, in the corner of the pen in a bed of hay.<br><br>Rose waited for Sam to open the birthing pen gate, then rushed in to the mother and attempted to rouse her, nipping at her nose and chest.<br><br>Sam opened his bag and pulled out scissors, forceps, bandages, syringes, a jar of iodine, antibiotics, and some rope and salve. He was serious and calm as he followed Rose&#x2019;s lead, this small black and white dog, with those piercing eyes, moving with speed and confidence.<br><br>The other sheep gathered in the pole barn up the hill, watching, intent and anxious. Rose glanced up at the crowd of ewes, and at the Blackface, their leader, who had appeared at the front of the flock. Rose&#x2019;s eyes and posture gave clear instructions&#x2014;stay back, stay away from Sam&#x2014;and they obeyed.<br><br>If necessary, she would use her teeth, pulling some wool to get things moving, or to stop things from moving. She rarely needed to do that. But tonight, particularly since there was no food around the lambing area, Rose knew they would keep their distance. The sheep wanted no part of a human or a dog in the middle of the night.<br><br>It was black and cold, and the ground was icy. Rose saw and smelled the amniotic fluid puddling under the ewe. Rose could see the almost imperceptible movement of the ewe&#x2019;s stomach, hear the faint breath, see the moisture in her eyes, the stream from her nostrils. She could hear the faintest of heartbeats.<br><br>She could smell the ewe&#x2019;s struggle.<br><br>Rose and Sam had done this before, many times.<br><br>Having failed to get the ewe to her feet, Rose backed up while Sam set up his light, kneeled down, rolled up his sleeves. She watched him rub salve on his hands before turning the ewe and plunging his arm into the dying mother, finding the lamb stuck in the uterine canal.<br><br>The smell was intense, and troubling. This was a bad sign. Lambs didn&#x2019;t last very long after the water had broken.<br><br>Sam muttered and cursed. He turned the lamb&#x2019;s feet until they were pointed in the right direction, then he grunted, pulled, and pulled again. Finally, Rose saw him draw out his hand, and with it, the lamb. The small, matted creature was not moving.<br><br>Sam dipped his pocketknife in a bottle and then used it to cut the umbilical cord. Then he stood, lifted the lamb by its feet, and swung it, left and right, in the cold air, to get its heart beating. The lamb was slick with fluids, and the air was frigid. Lambs can die quickly in these conditions. If they&#x2019;re healthy, their mothers will usually guide them through the hatchway to the warmth of the heat lamps.<br><br>Rose barked, excited. The lamb suddenly coughed and wheezed. It was alive. Rose ran around to the ewe&#x2019;s face and began nipping at her nose, urging her to her feet.<br><br>The dog and the farmer worked with urgency. The cold was biting and Rose felt the sting of it in her paws. Her whiskers were covered in ice. She needed to get the ewe up quickly, had to get her to clean her lamb. And the lamb needed nourishment.<br><br>Sam pulled out a plastic bottle with sheep&#x2019;s milk that he had stored in the freezer and thawed, putting it gently in the lamb&#x2019;s mouth. He pulled a syringe from his other pocket&#x2014;a vitamin booster, for strength and energy&#x2014;and gave the lamb a shot. Rose kept working to get the mother up, so she and her lamb could bond by smell and know each other.<br><br>The ewe began to stir, looking at Rose. The dog did not waver or back off, but barked and lunged, nipped and kept her eyes locked on the ewe&#x2019;s.<br><br>The ewe closed her eyes, reopened them. She was suddenly alarmed, breathing more heavily now, as she struggled to get to her feet.

She has co-authored several books with Cathy Winks, including The Mother&#39;s Guide to Sex (Random, 2001); The Woman&#39;s Guide to Sex on the Web (Harper San Francisco, 1999); and The New Good Vibrations Guide to Sex (Cleis,1997). Her interest in accurate sex education was sparked by the nun who taught eighth-grade religion class and counseled her students to &#34;think of a hamburger when you find your thoughts straying to the impure -- it will distract you.&#34; Suspecting that God really didn&#39;t intend for us to choose between two things as wonderful as sex and food, she made a point of learning as much about sex as she could. She&#39;s spent the last 15 years educating herself and others about the wonders of sex, primarily through writing and working with two women&#39;s sex toy stores, Libida.com and Good Vibrations. Semans believes that all people, including children, deserve information about their sexuality in order to lead more fulfilling lives, which is what inspired her newest book, The Mother&#39;s Guide to Sex.</p><h2>Voices in the Garden</h2><p>VOICES IN THE GARDEN</p><p><p>Sir Dirk Bogarde was an English actor and novelist.

Thus, in an elegant anagram (translation = lost in an art), Pulitzer Prize-winning author and pioneering cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter hints at what led him to pen a deep personal homage to the witty sixteenth-century French poet Cl�ment Marot.&#x201d;<i>Le ton beau de Marot</i>&#x201d; literally means &#x201d;The sweet tone of Marot&#x201d;, but to a French ear it suggests &#x201d;Le tombeau de Marot&#x201d; that is, &#x201d;The tomb of Marot&#x201d;. That double entendre foreshadows the linguistic exuberance of this book, which was sparked a decade ago when Hofstadter, under the spell of an exquisite French miniature by Marot, got hooked on the challenge of recreating both its sweet message and its tight rhymes in English jumping through two tough hoops at once.In the next few years, he not only did many of his own translations of Marot's poem, but also enlisted friends, students, colleagues, family, noted poets, and translators even three state-of-the-art translation programs! to try their hand at this subtle challenge.The rich harvest is represented here by 88 wildly diverse variations on Marot's little theme. Yet this barely scratches the surface of <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i>, for small groups of these poems alternate with chapters that run all over the map of language and thought.Not merely a set of translations of one poem, <i>Le Ton beau de Marot </i>is an autobiographical essay, a love letter to the French language, a series of musings on life, loss, and death, a sweet bouquet of stirring poetry but most of all, it celebrates the limitless creativity fired by a passion for the music of words.Dozens of literary themes and creations are woven into the picture, including Pushkin's<i> Eugene Onegin</i>, Dante's <i>Inferno,</i> Salinger's <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, Villon's<i> Ballades, </i>Nabokov's essays, Georges Perec's <i>La Disparition,</i> Vikram Seth's <i>Golden Gate, </i>Horace's odes, and more.Rife with stunning form-content interplay, crammed with creative linguistic experiments yet always crystal-clear, this book is meant not only for lovers of literature, but also for people who wish to be brought into contact with current ideas about how creativity works, and who wish to see how today's computational models of language and thought stack up next to the human mind.<i>Le Ton beau de Marot </i>is a sparkling, personal, and poetic exploration aimed at both the literary and the scientific world, and is sure to provoke great excitement and heated controversy among poets and translators, critics and writers, and those involved in the study of creativity and its elusive wellsprings.</p><p>In the fall of 1537, a child was confined to bed for some time. The French poet Cl�ment Marot wrote her a get-well poem, 28 lines long, each line a scant three syllables. In the mid-1980s, the outrageously gifted Douglas R. Hofstadter--<i>il miglior fabbro</i> of <i>Godel, Escher, Bach</i>--first attempted to translate this "sweet, old, small elegant French poem into English." He was later to challenge friends, relations, and colleagues to do the same. The results were exceptional, and are now contained in <i>Le Ton Beau De Marot</i>, a sunny exploration of scholarly and linguistic play and love's infinity. Less sunny, however, is the tragedy that hangs over Hofstadter's book, the sudden death of his wife, Carol, from a brain tumor. (Her translation is among the book's finest.)<p> Marot's poem, in Hofstadter's initial translation (he is to compose many more), begins: "My sweet, / I bid you / A good day; / The stay / Is prison. / Health / Recover, / Then open / Your door ... "--a slim frame on which to hang 600 or so pages of text. But the book is far more than a compendium of translators' triumphs (with the occasional misstep). Most of the renderings are original and lively, some lovely, though Hofstadter often feels compelled to improve them. He lightly laments that Bill Cavnar's rendering, "though superb along so many dimensions at once, still seems to lack a bit of that intangible verbal sparkle that I associate with the deepest Maroticity."</p><p> Hofstadter's talents lie in linking his intoxication, erudition, and vision with humor, autobiography, and free association. His book takes on "rigidists," asks questions like, "Is plagiarism potentially creative?" and strives to define linguistic soul. Along the way, it accords the same level of respect to the seemingly trivial: sex jokes, Texas jokes, <i>The Seven Year Itch</i>, and the puzzle of how someone you love can hate a food that you adore. Throughout there is pun, ingenuity, and above all, love for language--which can compress distance and, through constraint, lead to freedom.</p><b>Douglas R.

New Mexican Comancheros were free to roam the plains to trade goods, and when Americans introduced, the Comanches and New Mexicans even joined in a loose, informal alliance that made the American occupation of the plains very costly. Similarly, in the 1860s the Comancheros would trade guns and ammunition to the Comanches and Kiowas, allowing them to wreck a gruesome toll on the advancing Texans.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Charles L.

He divides his time between Oxford and Newmarket in Suffolk, where he lives with his wife and two sons.In this blood and guts tale of ancient warfare, Oxford lecturer Sidebottom introduces readers to Marcus Clodius Bastilla, a third-century warrior who has risen through the ranks of the Roman army to achieve citizenship and the honorific of <i>Dux Ripea</i>. Charged by the emperors Valerian and Gallienus with the responsibility of defending the empire's eastern borders, Bastilla says good-bye to his new wife and sets sail for the East. Once he arrives at the Syrian city of Arete on the banks of the Euphrates, Bastilla organizes his legionaries to defend against the besieging Sassanid Persian army and hold out until reinforcements can arrive. In addition to having his hands full with the invading army, Bastilla must also deal with traitors, saboteurs, assassins and patrician officers who resent obeying the orders of a low-born superior. How the brave and resourceful former barbarian defends himself from forces both within and without the city walls forms the spine of this action-packed and detail-rich narrative. This novel of sharp swords and blunt wit should find an appreciative audience among bloodthirsty battle boys of all ages. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The so-called Committee of Public Safety, which directed the Terror, ordered 2,400 executions in July 1794 in Paris alone, and across France 30,000 people lost their lives. R. R. Palmer's <i>Twelve Who Ruled</i> is the classic study of the twelve men who made up the committee, the most famous of whom was Robespierre. Palmer approached each man as an individual, describing and explaining his inner motivations and dramatically portraying his revolutionary role. In addition, he saw the Committee of Public Safety as the prototype of modern dictatorships and the Reign of Terror as an early incarnation of the totalitarian state.</p><br><br><p>Palmer's other great classic, also from Princeton, is his <i>Age of the Democratic Revolution: A Political History of Europe and America</i>, 1760-1800 in two volumes (vol. 1, <i>The Challenge</i>, 1959; vol. 2, <i>The Struggle</i>, 1964), for which Palmer received the prestigious Bancroft Prize in 1960. Palmer&#x2019;s key idea was that a single great democratic revolution against an entrenched aristocracy swept Western culture between 1760 and 1800, and that the American Revolution was the most important single event in precipitating this revolutionary era. These two volumes have been of singular significance for historians on both sides of the Atlantic and together with his <i>Twelve Who Ruled</i> established Palmer as one of the most important historians of his generation.</p><br><p>This modern classic is being reissued in recognition of the bicentennial of the French Revolution.</p><br><p>From a review of an earlier edition: "This is wholly an admirable book: it is based upon all the most recent researches and itself makes some original contributions to scholarship; it is written in a bright popular style and deserves as warm a welcome from the general reader as from the historian."--A.J.P.

(<i>New York Times</i>)</p><h2>America&#39;s Real War</h2><p>There is a tug of war going on for the future of America. At one end of the rope are those who think America is a secular nation; at the other end are those who believe religion is at the root of our country's foundation. In this paperback release of the thought-provoking America's Real War, renowned leader and speaker Rabbi Daniel Lapin encourages America to re-embrace the Judeo-Christian values on which our nation was founded, and logically demonstrates why those values are crucial to America's strength in the new millennium.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Rabbi Daniel Lapin is a businessman, author, syndicated talk radio host, and speaker.

We Just Disagree with One Another About<br>What the Source of the Danger Is.</i><br><br>Acaptured prisoner of war is required to declare only his name, rank, service<br>number, and date of birth. This is because all the truly profound<br>information about him is already revealed by his uniform. That distinctive<br>garment eloquently proclaims the side for which the warrior is fighting.<br>It equally effectively reveals those values for which the soldier is willing to risk his<br>life.<br><br>Although not a prisoner of war, I am among those engaged in a fierce American conflict. It may be the fiercest internal conflict in American history since the Abolitionist<br>movement in the 1800s. It is certainly deeply consequential. And I am in the heart of it. This book is my uniform.<br><br>In addition to the information contained in my uniform, the U.S. Military Code of<br>Conduct grants you the right to the equivalent of my name, rank, service number, and<br>date of birth. Here is the vital data: I am an Orthodox rabbi. I am the son of a famous<br>Orthodox rabbi and the brother of two more. My teachers were the great scholars who<br>headed the Gateshead Talmudic Academy in England, some of whom were uncles and<br>cousins. I became a disciple of my great-uncle, the revered Rabbi Eliyahu (Elijah) Lopian (the original family name) during my many years of study at the theological academy (or yeshiva) of Kfar Hassidim in Israel. Although I often fall short, I do my best to live my life and raise my children according to the laws of the five books of Moses, our holy Torah, and the customs of Moses and of Israel.<br><br>Because it is so unusual these days for a rabbi to say nice things about Christians, I<br>consider it necessary to explain that I am not now, nor have I ever been, a Christian. I<br>profess no special expertise of the books known as the New Testament. Being infatuated with Judaism and the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, I dedicate my study time to expanding my familiarity with Jewish theology. In the midst of a lifelong love affair with the searing truth of the Torah, I reject any notion of theological compatibility between Judaism and Christianity; I do not believe a Jew can also be a Christian without betraying his Judaism. One faith, Judaism, has produced the longest-lasting, continuous culture in the history of the world, while the other, Christianity, has been responsible, among other things, for the founding of America, the greatest civilization the world has ever known, and for making America great. This book will describe how a weakened Christianity in America threatens all Americans, including Jews.<br><br>WHY I FIGHT THIS BATTLE<br>My defense of a religion other than my own has earned me considerable hostility from<br>many Americans. This book will also describe why so many secularized Americans and<br>so many Jews wrongly fear Christianity in America today.<br><br>Why have I willingly volunteered to fight this battle? Why have I subjected my wife<br>and children, as well as my friends, to all the disruptions, difficulties&#x2014;and yes, dangers&#x2014;of this struggle? I find myself driven to defend American Christian conservatives for three compelling reasons.<br><br>The first is because I desperately want my children, and one day (God willing) my<br>grandchildren and their descendants, to have the option of living peacefully and productively<br>in the United States of America. I am certain this depends upon America<br>regaining its Christian-oriented moral compass.<br><br>The second reason is that I am appalled by the great injustice being perpetrated by<br>those Jewish organizations that engage in anti-Christian bigotry. Although many of them were founded explicitly to fight bigotry, and for many years did just that, today the shrill rhetoric and hate-filled propaganda found in their direct mail is discriminatory and divisive. The very same Jewish organizations would be the loudest protesters were anything even remotely similar being said by non-Jews about Jews. Justice demands that a member of the group doing the defaming also does the defending. God&#x2019;s blueprint clearly included the emergence of Christianity. After all, Christianity has brought monotheism to more people than any other force during the past two millennia. American Jews in particular, owe a debt of gratitude to Christians for the safe haven America has been since its founding.<br><br>Third, I wish to counter the chilul Hashem, the desecration of God&#x2019;s name, that is<br>caused when His words are misrepresented. Organizations and individuals, many of<br>whom claim to speak in the name of Judaism, are inflicting enormous harm on America<br>by promoting policies that traditional Judaism finds abhorrent. I want to help both<br>Jewish and non-Jewish Americans differentiate between Jewish positions and positions<br>held by some Jews who are more devoted to secularism than Judaism.<br><br>In defending Christianity in America, I am not suggesting that Jews ought to<br>embrace the Christian faith. I believe that all Jews should actively embrace traditional<br>Judaism; I have spent many years of my life helping to bring that about. But I am suggesting, at the very least, that Jews should stop speaking and acting as if Christian<br>America is their enemy. I feel that all Americans who love freedom, whether or not they<br>are religious, should be reassured, not frightened, by the reawakening of earnest<br>Christianity throughout the land. I shall try to establish that Jews as well as other minorities have the most to fear from a post-Christian America.<br><br>A NATION IN CRISIS<br>I believe America is in decline&#x2014;not compared to five or ten years ago, but when compared to the years following World War II up until the early sixties. Most Americans who can remember back thirty-five years or so sense that life has become more squalid, expensive, and dangerous. Some attribute this to inadequate government attention to social problems, while others lay the blame on a more fundamental spiritual malaise. One thing is clear however: fewer and fewer Americans remain unaware of, or indifferent to America&#x2019;s decline. Whether it is in the hollow expressions on the faces of some youngsters, the vulgarity of entertainment, or the many other little signs that all is not well in America, most of us are at least concerned about the future.<br><br>There is a tug-of-war going on for the future of our country. Some are enthusiastic<br>pullers for one or the other side. Many other Americans remain uncommitted to the<br>entire agenda of either side but feel the need to make their voices heard one way or the other.<br><br>What do the two ends of the rope represent? I believe the basic question is whether<br>America is a secular or a religious nation. The very question sizzles with tension. Almost everybody has an opinion on this one. Furthermore, it is becoming less of an opinion and more of a deeply held fundamental worldview. Whichever view people hold, they do so with utter conviction.<br><br>One end of the rope is anchored by those who ask, &#x201c;How can any intelligent, rational<br>person late in the twentieth century view America as a religious nation?&#x201d; Some put it<br>this way, &#x201c;Do you really want to live in a theocracy? Look at Iran.&#x201d; To people on this end of the rope, Judeo-Christian tradition represents primitive tribalism and intolerance, the most damning indictment of our age.<br><br>The folks on this end of the rope are joined by many citizens who used to occupy<br>the undecided middle ground. While lacking a doctrinal embrace of secularism, these<br>Americans have come to feel that religious America poses the real threat to our continuity, so they instinctively migrate to the end of the rope opposite from religious conservatives. Although not committed to every nuance of secularism, they consider it the lesser of two evils and lend their not inconsiderable weight to the left of the rope.<br><br>Across the field on the other end, are those Americans who feel increasingly alienated<br>by this &#x201c;enlightened&#x201d; perspective which denies the importance of America&#x2019;s history<br>and culture. These religious conservatives are joined by many other Americans who,<br>while admittedly unenthusiastic about religion, are even less enthusiastic about the<br>changes that secular liberalism has brought about in their towns and communities.<br><br>In the pages following, I will argue that America is a religious nation and the corresponding interpretation of our history and culture is the correct one. But I shall go much further than that. America is not just religious but is rooted in one particular religious tradition. As an Orthodox rabbi, I will make a compelling case for America as a Christian nation and the need for our nation to be based on Judeo-Christian ethics in order to survive. Despite the fact that Judaism and Christianity have totally differing theologies, there is still one Judeo-Christian ethic. Which is to say that how people order their lives and societies; how they organize their families and behave toward one another turns out to be more similar than different. The origins, legal system, ethos and moral sense of America are entirely Judeo-Christian.<br><br>A Jew and a Christian at one end of the rope have more in common with one another<br>in terms of vision for this country than each may have with his coreligionists at the other end. This is because the tug-of-war is not about theological or philosophical differences but about real life disagreements about things like taxes, crime, welfare, and family life. No matter the philosophy of belief that brings us to our view of how things ought to be, we tend to agree with others holding the same view regardless of the belief that brought them to that view.<br><br>But this begs another question asked by well-intentioned but worried Americans.<br>Many of those pulling for the secular side of the tug-of-war may concede that there is at least some truth to the Judeo-Christian religious foundation of America. At the same time they argue that nowadays a new secular public policy posture has become necessary because of America&#x2019;s increasing diversity. Otherwise, they argue, America will become intolerant of its minorities who may not share in our founding ethic. The question for those who take this position is not, &#x201c;Is America a Christian nation?&#x201d; but &#x201c;Should America be a Christian nation?&#x201d; As a non-Christian myself, I still insist the answer must be yes. I shall try to demonstrate that the choice is between a benign Christian culture and a sinister secular one.<br><br>I feel that although they may seem unrelated, almost every social pathology and<br>nearly every sign of civic disarray can be traced to one thing: the extirpation of religion<br>from American public life during the past three and a half decades. Very little tells us as much about a culture than how it views the transcendent questions of life. A culture&#x2019;s<br>prospects for success and durability are best revealed by examining what it considers the purpose of life, what is death, how sex should be treated, and similar questions that most of us answer in one of only two ways. Either we consult the traditions of our faith, or, rejecting faith, we seek emotionally satisfying answers. Sometimes we later buttress the answers we have already chosen.<br><br>WHAT WILL LIFE BE LIKE FOR OUR CHILDREN?<br>One of the great gifts of serious religion is the idea of hierarchy. Some things are better than others and some things are more evil than others. It is a greater good to bestow charity on a poor man by offering him a net along with instructions for its use rather than to fling him a fish. Attacking a passerby in order to steal her purse is a greater evil than smoking a cigarette. We must renew our confidence in making moral judgments. We have to be able to identify the direction in which trends are moving. If there is moral movement in each generation, we need to know the direction and the velocity of the movement. This helps us understand what tomorrow might look like, and it helps us decide whether we welcome that particular vision of tomorrow for our children. If our culture is changing rapidly, as I think it may be doing, and if we are changing by becoming coarser and more subject to the tireless ministrations of a government determined to become ever more involved in every corner of citizens&#x2019; lives, then I experience great concern. It means that we are further under water than we were last generation. And if nothing is going to change that course, what will life be like for our children?<br><br>This great American civilization, perhaps the greatest the world has ever known, is<br>not facing imminent extinction. However, life deteriorates significantly long before the<br>very end. And it usually deteriorates fastest for those most dependent on society&#x2019;s civilizing institutions. Those not big and fearsome enough to defend themselves suffer more than others when city streets and parks become menacing. Those not wealthy enough to afford private schools for their children suffer most when public education fails. Those who live from paycheck to paycheck are most vulnerable to creeping and constant tax increases. Those trying to raise children who will honor their parents and their parents&#x2019; values are most hampered by antifamily legislation and antifamily entertainment. Those trying to build new business enterprises find themselves crippled by confiscatory taxation and crippling regulation.<br><br>Are you Jewish, Christian, or neither? Are you indifferent to religion, fervently for, or<br>ardently opposed to faith? It matters little. As long as you devoutly wish for America to<br>remain a beacon of hope and freedom in this troubled world, I appeal to you. Ideas do<br>have consequences and big ideas have big consequences. If there exists an idea bigger than God, I do not know what it might be. What Americans feel about God probably has greater impact on our national future than what we think about almost anything else. Or to put it another way, what we really think about God deep down within our hearts is likely to influence what we think about almost everything else.<br><br>I intend to show you how changing attitudes about God have almost entirely<br>reshaped America during the past three or four decades. Furthermore, I want to show<br>how virtually every one of us has been a participant, sometimes unwittingly, in allowing<br>these changes to take place. Some of us have actively helped to bring these changes about in the belief that we have been improving society. Others have been swept along by the loud enthusiasms of the changers and our passive acceptance of each small step has allowed these big changes to envelop our lives.<br><br>I intend this book as a guide to what we have done, to what we have allowed to take<br>place, and to where it all might lead. Those readers who applaud the changes will smile<br>knowingly as I identify the milestones on our road downhill. Those who tremble at what<br>we have come to accept as normal will see my words as a road map for retracing our steps and regaining the right path to continue the great story that is American history.<br><br>America is indeed imperiled. We all know that. We just disagree with one another<br>about what the source of the danger is. Some think religious fervor threatens while others feel that secularism is the danger.</p><h2>The Road Home</h2><p>Sent from Michigan to Pennsylvania following the tragic death of her Amish parents, Lena Rose Schwartz grieves her loss and the separation from her nine siblings.

He lives in Gloucestershire.ONE<br><br>London. Trinity term one week old. Implacable June weather. Fiona Maye, a High Court judge, at home on Sunday evening, supine on a chaise longue, staring past her stockinged feet toward the end of the room, toward a partial view of recessed bookshelves by the fireplace and, to one side, by a tall window, a tiny Renoir lithograph of a bather, bought by her thirty years ago for fifty pounds. Probably a fake. Below it, centered on a round walnut table, a blue vase. No memory of how she came by it. Nor when she last put flowers in it. The fireplace not lit in a year. Blackened raindrops falling irregularly into the grate with a ticking sound against balled-up yellowing newsprint. A Bokhara rug spread on wide polished floorboards. Looming at the edge of vision, a baby grand piano bearing silver-framed family photos on its deep black shine. On the floor by the chaise longue, within her reach, the draft of a judgment. And Fiona was on her back, wishing all this stuff at the bottom of the sea.<br><br>In her hand was her second Scotch and water. She was feeling shaky, still recovering from a bad moment with her husband. She rarely drank, but the Talisker and tap water was a balm, and she thought she might cross the room to the sideboard for a third. Less Scotch, more water, for she was in court tomorrow and she was duty judge now, available for any sudden demand, even as she lay recuperating. He had made a shocking declaration and placed an impossible burden on her. For the first time in years, she had actually shouted, and some faint echo still resounded in her ears. "You idiot! You fucking idiot!" She had not sworn out loud since her carefree teenage visits to Newcastle, though a potent word sometimes intruded on her thoughts when she heard self-serving evidence or an irrelevant point of law.<br><br>And then, not long after that, wheezy with outrage, she had said loudly, at least twice, "How dare you!"<br><br>It was hardly a question, but he answered it calmly. "I need it. I'm fifty-nine. This is my last shot. I've yet to hear evidence for an afterlife."<br><br>A pretentious remark, and she had been lost for a reply. She simply stared at him, and perhaps her mouth was open. In the spirit of the staircase, she had a response now, on the chaise longue. "Fifty-nine? Jack, you're sixty! It's pathetic, it's banal."<br><br>What she had actually said, lamely, was, "This is too ridiculous."<br><br>"Fiona, when did we last make love?"<br><br>When did they? He had asked this before, in moods plaintive to querulous. But the crowded recent past can be difficult to recall. The Family Division teemed with strange differences, special pleading, intimate half-truths, exotic accusation. And as in all branches of law, fine-grained particularities of circumstance needed to be assimilated at speed. Last week, she heard final submissions from divorcing Jewish parents, unequally Orthodox, disputing their daughters' education. The draft of her completed judgment was on the floor beside her. Tomorrow, coming before her again would be a despairing Englishwoman, gaunt, pale, highly educated, mother of a five-year-old girl, convinced, despite assurances to the court to the contrary, that her daughter was about to be removed from the jurisdiction by the father, a Moroccan businessman and strict Muslim, to a new life in Rabat, where he intended to settle. Otherwise, routine wrangles over residence of children, over houses, pensions, earnings, inheritance. It was the larger estates that came to the High Court. Wealth mostly failed to bring extended happiness. Parents soon learned the new vocabulary and patient procedures of the law, and were dazed to find themselves in vicious combat with the one they once loved. And waiting offstage, boys and girls first-named in the court documents, troubled little Bens and Sarahs, huddling together while the gods above them fought to the last, from the Family Proceedings Court, to the High Court, to the Court of Appeal.<br><br>All this sorrow had common themes, there was a human sameness to it, but it continued to fascinate her. She believed she brought reasonableness to hopeless situations. On the whole, she believed in the provisions of family law. In her optimistic moments she took it as a significant marker in civilization's progress to fix in the statutes the child's needs above its parents'. Her days were full, and in the evenings recently, various dinners, something at Middle Temple for a retiring colleague, a concert at Kings Place (Schubert, Scriabin), and taxis, Tube trains, dry-cleaning to collect, a letter to draft about a special school for the cleaning lady's autistic son, and finally sleep. Where was the sex? At that moment, she couldn't recall.<br><br>"I don't keep a record."<br><br>He spread his hands, resting his case.<br><br>She had watched as he crossed the room and poured himself a measure of Scotch, the Talisker she was drinking now. Lately, he was looking taller, easier in his movements. While his back was turned to her she had a cold premonition of rejection, of the humiliation of being left for a young woman, of being left behind, useless and alone. She wondered if she should simply go along with anything he wanted, then rejected the thought.<br><br>He had come back toward her with his glass. He wasn't offering her a Sancerre the way he usually did around this time.<br><br>"What do you want, Jack?"<br><br>"I'm going to have this affair."<br><br>"You want a divorce."<br><br>"No. I want everything the same. No deception."<br><br>"I don't understand."<br><br>"Yes you do. Didn't you once tell me that couples in long marriages aspire to the condition of siblings? We've arrived, Fiona. I've become your brother. It's cozy and sweet and I love you, but before I drop dead, I want one big passionate affair."<br><br>Mistaking her amazed gasp for laughter, for mockery perhaps, he said roughly, "Ecstasy, almost blacking out with the thrill of it. Remember that? I want one last go, even if you don't. Or perhaps you do."<br><br>She stared at him in disbelief.<br><br>"There it is, then."<br><br>This was when she had found her voice and told him what kind of idiot he was. She had a powerful grip on what was conventionally correct. That he had, as far as she knew, always been faithful made his proposition all the more outrageous. Or if he'd deceived her in the past he'd done it brilliantly. She already knew the name of the woman. Melanie. Not so remote from the name of a fatal form of skin cancer. She knew she could be obliterated by his affair with this twenty-eight-year-old statistician.<br><br>"If you do this it'll be the end for us. It's as simple as that."<br><br>"Is this a threat?"<br><br>"My solemn promise."<br><br>By then she had regained her temper. And it did seem simple. The moment to propose an open marriage was before the wedding, not thirty-five years later. To risk all they had so that he might relive a passing sensual thrill! When she tried to imagine wanting something like it for herself&#x2014;her "last fling" would be her first&#x2014;she could think only of disruption, assignations, disappointment, ill-timed phone calls. The sticky business of learning to be with someone new in bed, newly devised endearments, all the fakery. Finally, the necessary disentangling, the effort required to be open and sincere. And nothing quite the same when she came away. No, she preferred an imperfect existence, the one she had now.<br><br>But on the chaise longue it rose before her, the true extent of the insult, how he was prepared to pay for his pleasures with her misery. Ruthless. She had seen him single-minded at the expense of others, most often in a good cause. This was new. What had changed? He had stood erect, feet well apart as he poured his single malt, the fingers of his free hand moving to a tune in his head, some shared song perhaps, not shared with her. Hurting her and not caring&#x2014;that was new. He had always been kind, loyal and kind, and kindness, the Family Division daily proved, was the essential human ingredient. She had the power to remove a child from an unkind parent and she sometimes did. But remove herself from an unkind husband? When she was weak and desolate? Where was her protective judge?<br><br>Self-pity in others embarrassed her, and she wouldn't have it now. She was having a third drink instead. But she poured only a token measure, added much water and returned to her couch. Yes, it had been the kind of conversation of which she should have taken notes. Important to remember, to measure the insult carefully. When she threatened to end the marriage if he went ahead, he had simply repeated himself, told her again how he loved her, always would, that there was no other life but this, that his unmet sexual needs caused him great unhappiness, that there was this one chance and he wanted to take it with her knowledge and, so he hoped, her assent. He was speaking to her in the spirit of openness. He could have done it "behind her back." Her thin, unforgiving back.<br><br>"Oh," she murmured. "That's decent of you, Jack."<br><br>"Well, actually..." he said, and didn't finish.<br><br>She guessed he was about to tell her the affair had already begun and she couldn't bear to hear it. Didn't need to. She saw it. A pretty statistician working on the diminishing probability of a man returning to an embittered wife. She saw a sunlit morning, an unfamiliar bathroom, and Jack, still decently muscled, pulling a half-unbuttoned clean white linen shirt over his head in that impatient way he had, a discarded shirt tossed toward the laundry basket hanging by one arm before sliding to the floor. Perdition. It would happen, with or without her consent.<br><br>"The answer's no." She had used a rising tone, like a flinty schoolmarm. She added, "What else would you expect me to say?"<br><br>She felt helpless and wanted the conversation to end. There was a judgment to approve before tomorrow for publication in the Family Law Reports. The fates of two Jewish schoolgirls had already been settled in the ruling she had delivered in court, but the prose needed to be smoothed, as did the respect owed to piety in order to be proof against an appeal. Outside, summer rain beat against the windows; distantly, from beyond Gray's Inn Square, tires hissed on drenched asphalt. He would leave her and the world would go on.<br><br>His face had been tight as he shrugged and turned to leave the room. At the sight of his retreating back, she felt the same cold fear. She would have called after him but for the dread of being ignored. And what could she say? Hold me, kiss me, have the girl. She had listened to his footsteps down the hall, their bedroom door closing firmly, then silence settling over their flat, silence and the rain that hadn't stopped in a month.<br>First the facts. Both parties were from the tight folds of the strictly observant Haredi community in north London. The Bernsteins' marriage was arranged by their parents, with no expectation of dissent. Arranged, not forced, both parties, in rare accord, insisted. Thirteen years on, all agreed, mediator, social worker and judge included, that here was a marriage beyond repair. The couple were now separated. Between them they managed with difficulty the care of the two children, Rachel and Nora, who lived with the mother and had extensive contact with the father. Marriage breakdown had started in the early years. After the difficult birth of the second girl, the mother was unable to conceive again, due to radical surgery. The father had set his heart on a large family and thus began the painful unraveling. After a period of depression (prolonged, said the father; brief, said the mother), she studied at the Open University, gained a good qualification and entered on a career in teaching at primary level once the younger had started school. This arrangement did not suit the father or the many relatives. Within the Haredim, whose traditions were unbroken for centuries, women were expected to raise children, the more the better, and look after the home. A university degree and a job were highly unusual. A senior figure of good standing in the community was called as a witness by the father and said as much.<br><br>Men did not receive much education either. From their mid-teens, they were expected to give most of their time to studying the Torah. Generally, they did not go to university. Partly for this reason, many Haredim were of modest means. But not the Bernsteins, though they would be when their lawyers' bills were settled. A grandparent with a share in a patent for an olive-pitting machine had settled money on the couple jointly. They expected to spend everything they had on their respective silks, both women well known to the judge. On the surface, the dispute concerned Rachel and Nora's schooling. However, at stake was the entire context of the girls' growing up. It was a fight for their souls.<br><br>Haredi boys and girls were educated separately to preserve their purity. Modish clothes, television and the Internet were forbidden, and so was mixing with children who were allowed such distractions. Homes that did not observe strict kosher rules were out of bounds. Every aspect of daily existence was well covered by established customs. The problem had started with the mother, who was breaking with the community, though not with Judaism. Against the father's objections, she was already sending the girls to a coeducational Jewish secondary school where television, pop music, the Internet and mixing with non-Jewish children were permitted. She wanted her girls to stay on at school past the age of sixteen and to go to university if they wished. In her written evidence she said she wanted her daughters to know more about how others lived, to be socially tolerant, to have the career opportunities she never had, and as adults to be economically self-sufficient, with the chance of meeting the sort of husband with professional skills who could help to support a family. Unlike her husband, who gave all his time to studying, and teaching the Torah eight hours a week without pay.<br><br>For all the reasonableness of her case, Judith Bernstein&#x2014;angular pale face, uncovered frizzy ginger hair fastened with a huge blue clasp&#x2014;was not an easy presence in court. A constant passing forward with freckly agitated fingers of notes to her counsel, much muted sighing, eye-rolling and lip-pursing whenever her husband's counsel spoke, inappropriate rummaging and jiggling in an outsized camel leather handbag, removing from it at one low point in a long afternoon a pack of cigarettes and a lighter&#x2014;provocative items in her husband's scheme, surely&#x2014;and lining them up side by side, on hand for when the court rose. Fiona saw all this from her advantage of height but pretended not to.<br><br>Mr. Bernstein&#x2019;s written evidence was intended to persuade the judge that his wife was a selfish woman with &#x201c;anger- management &nbsp;problems&#x201d; (in the Family Division, a common, often mutual charge) who had turned her back on her marriage vows, argued with his parents and her community,&nbsp;cutting the girls off from both. On the contrary, Judith said from the stand, it was her parents-in-law who would not see her or the children until they had returned to the proper way of life, disowned the modern world, including&nbsp;social media, and until she kept a home that was kosher by their terms.<br><br>Mr. Julian Berns...</p><h2>Felidae</h2><p>An internationally acclaimed suspense novel features the adventures of Francis, a house cat who, in trying to catch the murderer of his feline friends, meets up with a bizarre cat cult, a kitty computer whiz, and a perceptive Persian. 20,000 first printing. $20,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanA clever, offbeat thriller in which the sleuth and most of the other main characters are cats, this first novel by Turkish-born Pirincci, who lives in Bonn, won Germany's prize for best crime novel of the year in 1990. As an allegory on Germany's Nazi past, it is facile and ambivalent. The detective/narrator, Francis, an irrepressibly curious house cat, deduces that whoever is murdering the neighborhood tabbys has a warped mind and is attempting to breed a "super race" of felines. After discovering a fanatical cult of self-flagellating felines who worship a martyred cat, Claudandus, Francis is aided by Pascal, a cat who uses a computer, in unearthing another clue--the journal of a half-mad professor who performed sadistic laboratory experiments on cats. The corpses of countless feline victims are thrown into a catacomb guarded by the Persian cat Jesaja, a pathetic dupe who prays both to Yahweh (god of the Hebrews) and to "our blessed Prophet," the murderer, believing that he is doing the Lord's will. Is Pirincci satirizing monotheistic religion, or the alleged passivity of Jews who believed that Hitler would spare them? Such troubling questions are left unanswered. This fable is most effective as an acerbic commentary on humanity's follies, obtuseness and knack for evil. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Gun Digest Book of the 1911: A Complete Look at the Use, Care &amp; Repair of the 1911 Pistol, Vol. 1</h2><p><b>Does Your 1911 Stack Up?</b> When John Browning designed the Model 1911 pistol for Colt's Manufacturing Co. he created the standard by which pistols have been judged for more than 90 years.

Only a politician would try to tell you otherwise. And I&#x2019;m not talking about wars&#x2014;we&#x2019;re America, we win our wars.There are earthquakes, storms, volcanos. Plagues can appear out of nowhere and slaughter millions of people. Blights can wipe out our crops. A meteor the size of a bus could hit the earth and send us back to the Stone Age. An extraordinary solar .are could destroy our electronics or heat our atmosphere so much our crops all die and we starve. <br>And whom do we put in charge of helping us prepare to cope with such disasters? People whose only talent is for getting elected, and whose entire future consists of the runup to the next election. It&#x2019;s not their fault&#x2014; anybody who doesn&#x2019;t think and act that way won&#x2019;t win. It&#x2019;s the fundamental problem with democracy. No long-range thinking. So we&#x2019;re just sitting ducks, waiting for the next disaster. <br>If you want to know what destroyed the Roman Empire, it was two plagues, a century apart, that killed about thirty percent of the population each time. That&#x2019;s why there weren&#x2019;t enough soldiers to keep the legions at full strength.That&#x2019;s why the emperors had to invite in the barbarian tribes to farm the abandoned land and .ll the abandoned cities. <br>Only now we&#x2019;re talking about the whole world.Whom do we invite in to settle the empty land when it&#x2019;s the whole world that&#x2019;s been depopulated? <br>CHINMA WAS the fourth son of the third wife of the aging chief of his small tribe in the Kwara state of Nigeria.There was no shortage of <br>other sons, most of them adult, and nothing much was expected of Chinma. People constantly told him to shut up, even his mother, even when he wasn&#x2019;t saying anything. <br>He got the idea at a very young age that his very presence was annoying to everyone. <br>The easiest way to avoid getting cuffed or shoved or slapped or yelled at was to disappear. And the easiest way to disappear was to go up. People didn&#x2019;t look up very much. He could go up into the trees and keep company with the monkeys.They yelled at him, too, and threw things at him, but they were more afraid of him than he was of them, so it was actually fun. <br>That&#x2019;s why by the time he was twelve years old Chinma could climb any tree to the smallest branches that could bear his weight, and catch monkeys by enticing them with fruit while holding very, very still and looking in another direction until they were close enough for Chinma to make his grab. <br>All of this was useless to everyone until the happy day when Ire, the second son of the .rst wife, came back to the village from the big city, Ilorin, with news. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re paying money for white- face monkeys, especially if you can get the whole family.&#x201d; <br>Ire sat there in the yard in front of the big house, telling Father and the important brothers how much money, and who was paying, and how he found out about it, and then they started arguing about how they could go about catching the monkeys. <br>Meanwhile, Chinma ran to a good white- face monkey tree, climbed it, caught the papa- monkey, scampered back down, and brought the monkey to Ire. <br>All the men fell silent. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; asked Father. <br>&#x201c;Monkey- catcher,&#x201d; said Ire. And that became Chinma&#x2019;s new name. <br>Father was against paying Chinma anything for the monkeys he caught. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been feeding him for all these years, it&#x2019;s about time he started earning his way.&#x201d; But Ire said it was business, and in business you pay everybody something, so they&#x2019;ll work harder. <br>So now Chinma was important and had money, a hundred naira for every monkey, .ve hundred for the papa monkeys, two thousand if he brought in a whole family. He almost always got the families&#x2014; once he got the papa monkey, it was pretty easy to get the babies, and once he had the babies, he could use them as bait to get the mamas. <br>Ire bought cages for the monkeys and it didn&#x2019;t take many weeks before all the white- face monkeys in their neighborhood were gone or hiding. <br>So they got in the family truck and began to range far out into the country. Father and Ire had bribed all the right people, so there was no trouble with police&#x2014; or the roaming gangs of thugs and brigands who, as often as not, were the police out of uniform, or their brothers- in- law. It seemed like a safe way to make money&#x2014; and it all depended on Chinma&#x2019;s knack for climbing trees, winning the trust of monkeys, and bringing them down in good condition, every member of the family. <br>Ire said that somewhere far away&#x2014; South Africa or Great Britain or America&#x2014; scientists were studying the white- face monkey because its cries seemed to be like language. &#x201c;Not our language,&#x201d; said Father, and everyone laughed. Only it wasn&#x2019;t really all that funny, since only about three thousand people spoke their language, Ayere, and all of them lived right there in Kwara state. <br>They knew that other tribes had lost their language, for to survive in Nigeria you had to know at least one of the major languages&#x2014; Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa&#x2014; and if you had any hope of becoming educated, you had to learn En glish as well. How many languages could one head hold? <br>&#x201c;They ought to take us to America and study our language,&#x201d; said Ire. <br>&#x201c;With our luck,&#x201d; said Father, &#x201c;they&#x2019;d take us to Liberia.&#x201d; <br>But the truth was they were very lucky. This white- face monkey trade was bringing in cash, which there had never been very much of in their village of Oyi. &#x201c;Our oil well,&#x201d; Father called it. But he meant the monkeys&#x2014; not Chinma, even though Chinma caught every single monkey they sold. <br>When he mentioned this thought to Mother, she slapped his shoulder, twice, and very sternly told him, &#x201c;And who drives the truck? And who found out that these monkeys were worth something? And who fed you all your life till now? You think you&#x2019;re so important.&#x201d; <br>He apologized. But he was important, and he knew it. Nobody told him to shut up now, nobody in the family forgot his name. He was Monkey- catcher, and when the family was making money, he was right there, up a tree, catching it and bringing it down to them. <br>Until one day, in a remote stand of trees, not even large enough to call it a woods, surrounded by grassland on all sides, Chinma climbed a tree and found a troop of white- face monkeys that had no timidity at all. They did not scamper away from him. He did not have to coax them. They just sat there, waiting for him. The papa monkey hissed and showed his teeth. He snapped at Chinma, too. But he did not run away. <br>Chinma avoided the teeth and carried him down the tree. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a biter,&#x201d; said Chinma to Ire. <br>&#x201c;So am I,&#x201d; said Ire, and laughed. Whereupon the papa monkey twisted around in Ire&#x2019;s hand and bit him savagely on the thumb. Ire shouted and dropped the monkey, but Chinma immediately caught it again&#x2014; it was easy, because the monkey ran away so slowly. <br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; Chinma asked Ire. <br>&#x201c;Just put it in the cage,&#x201d; said Ire testily, and he resumed sucking on the wound. &#x201c;Get the rest of the family.&#x201d; <br>As Chinma brought down each of the babies, it was one of the other brothers, not Ire, who put them in the cages. Ire sat in the cab of the truck sucking on his wound and keeping up a low murmur of cursing. <br>There were only two females&#x2014; it was not a large troop, because it shared the stand of trees with an aggressive troop of red- bellied guenon monkeys. Chinma only recognized them because his family had brought him books about monkeys after he became valuable to them. These guenons were very rare, especially such a large group, and most people thought the only ones still alive were in the West Africa Biodiversity Hot Spot. It was very important that these monkeys were here. <br>Chinma decided not to tell the brothers about them.They would want to catch them and sell them, too, and Chinma knew it would take a lot more bribes because these monkeys were so endangered. <br>Instead, Chinma would tell a scientist about them, so they could get protected. Of course, that would mean going in to Ilorin, where they turned in the white- faces, which they had never let him do. But he had never asked, either. Maybe he was valuable enough now that they would let him. <br>Up a tree, he went for the largest female. Like the papa monkey, she didn&#x2019;t try to move away. As Chinma inched closer, she seemed to snarl and he expected her to try to bite. But she didn&#x2019;t. Instead, just as he got hold of her by the back and neck, she sneezed in his face. <br>Sneezed or gave him a raspberry&#x2014; he wasn&#x2019;t sure which&#x2014; but it amounted to the same thing. Monkey spit and snot all over his face. And he couldn&#x2019;t even wipe it off, because he needed one hand to hold her and the other hand to help him climb. And by the time he got down the tree, the stuff had dried on his face. <br>&#x201c;This one spits,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Or sneezes.&#x201d; <br>And this time he was listened to&#x2014; they held the she- monkey away from them as they took her to the cages in the back of the truck. <br>When all the white- face monkeys were in the back of the truck, Ire slid over on the front seat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not driving,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;I will!&#x201d; said Ade, who was the .rstborn son of Chinma&#x2019;s mother. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; said Ire. <br>Ade was stunned. Ire never let a son of one of the other mothers drive the truck. But when Ade climbed into the cab and turned the key to start the truck, Ire just looked out the window. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go home,&#x201d; said Ire. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going straight to Ilorin.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; asked Ade. <br>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; said Ire. But then Ire looked at...</p></p><h2>The Three Snow Bears</h2><p>This is in great condition and will ship out in under 24 hours.</p><p></p><h2>My People&#39;s Prayer Book, Vol. 5 : &#39;Birkhot Hashachar&#39; (Morning Blessings) Traditional Prayers, Modern Commentaries</h2><p><p><b>"The prayer book is our Jewish diary of the centuries, a collection of prayers composed by generations of those who came before us, as they endeavored to express the meaning of their lives and their relationship to God.

Evil rumors wormed through the gathering, furrowing brows. They were saying this would be the last gathering of the mountain men. The American Fur Company wouldn't buy a beaver plew at all, or if it did, it would pay so little that the mountaineers would starve. A man couldn't keep body and soul together in the mountains anymore. There were whispers that the company's tent store would have fewer items and these would be more costly than ever.It had reached Barnaby Skye's ears that the trapping brigades would be pared down and free trappers released from contracts; that long-term company men would be let go and that it didn't matter how good a job a man had done. He heard that the engages would find themselves as useless as a lame horse. He had heard that prime beaver pelts wouldn't bring fifty cents, and an entire year's hard work wouldn't keep a man in gunpowder. Those bleak rumors had built up an awful thirst in Barnaby Skye. A jug usually solved his problems, at least until the fat moon turned skinny.Just so long as they brought spirits, everything would be all right. Whiskey fueled each rendezvous. Without it, the trappers might as well go back to loading cotton or blacksmithing or plowing prairie soil or tallying waybills in a warehouse. But not one man among them believed that the year's supplies, now being packed in from Fort Union, would not include the pure grain alcohol that would be mixed with PopoAgie River water, a plug of tobacco or two, and some Cayenne pepper, that set the old coons to baying.One thing wasn't a rumor: fashion had shifted. In 1833, John Jacob Astor himself had discovered that silk top hats were the vogue; that hats made from beaver felt had vanished from the shops of Europe. In 1834 he had sold out his American Fur Company, and now the Upper Missouri Outfit was really Pratte, Chouteau and Company, though no one called it that. It was said that Astor, the great fur magnate, had known exactly what he was up to, and had gotten out of the fur business in the nick of time, richer than Midas and safer than Gibraltar.That was the dark talk those June days beside the Popo Agie, where it met the Wind River, among dour trappers waiting for the fun to begin and the trade whiskey to flow. The rest of the bad tidings wasn't rumor at all. No one had done well this year. Beaver were just about trapped out, except maybe on the streams controlled by the dangerous Blackfeet, and the competition of small outfits and free trappers had made life in the wilderness tougher than ever. No one had many plews to trade, and those few wouldn't bring much more than a few grains of DuPont powder and a bar of lead. There were men in camp who had put in a hard year's work and wouldn't get fifty dollars for it.And so, that June of 1838, Barnaby Skye waited for what life would bring, but without much hope. Maybe this would be the last rendezvous. He would have to find some other way to survive, and so would all the rest of the mountain men gathered together for the customary trade festival and summer fun that year. What would he do? What would he become? Who would he be in the hazy future? Was this the end of his sojourn in the wilds? Would he return to the sea, from whence he came?At least the American Fur Company had sent an outfit upriver, and it was due at any time now. The trappers could buy the traps and gunpowder and flannels and blankets they needed, and keep on going for another year if they had a fewpacks of skins to peddle. Maybe there was hope in that. Maybe things would get better.The trappers knew that much, because an express rider from Fort Union, located at the confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri, had told them the <i>Otter</i> was thrashing its way upstream with an outfit, a cargo of trade goods. But no one knew what bleak news would accompany the outfit, and not a man in that camp believed that the news would be very good. The St. Louis owners of the company had made it clear a year earlier they were losing money on the beaver business. Silk was in; beaver felt was out.Skye had been a brigade leader, a salaried man, one of only five in camp, so he had weathered the bad times a bit better than some of the trappers. They had numbed their legs for long hours in freezing water while baiting traps with castoreum and collecting beaver, found small comfort in winter's darkness, fought their way into obscure corners of the Rockies, only to find that other, equally determined trappers had cleaned out the streams. And now the beaver had all but vanished.Lucien Fontenelle, the veteran fur man in charge of field operations for the American Fur Company, was more optimistic."Beaver may be trapped out, but the company's not just in the beaver business," he confided to Skye as they lounged under a cottonwood, staring at snow-burdened peaks. "It can sell any pelt or hide we can ship.""For less plunder," Skye said.Fontenelle nodded. "Hard doings now," he said. "But we'll keep on going. That's what Pierre Chouteau himself told me; they'd keep on going. There's fur here and markets there. Maybe it'll be ermine or mink, deer and elk hides, weasel or otter, maybe even buffalo hides, but there's a market in the States."Skye was not a gloomy man, nor a pessimist, but all the bad talk was eroding his joy. For a dozen years he had been in the mountains, and was considered a veteran and even an oldman by the trapping fraternity, though he wasn't far into his thirties, and just beginning life.They considered him an odd duck, perhaps because of his British ways and his peculiar looks. He had been a pressed seaman, dragooned into the Royal Navy when he was a boy in London. He hadn't escaped the iron claw of His Majesty's Navy until he jumped ship at Fort Vancouver, on the Columbia River, seven years later, and made his way into the interior, with little more than his wits and a knife and belaying pin to keep him alive.Maybe that's why he was a more serious and somber man than most of the mountain fraternity; why he was more diligent and careful and willing to learn anything of value; why he treasured his liberty so much that he would die rather than surrender it. He had spent seven years in bondage, subservient to the whim of assorted boatswains, midshipmen, masters, captains, and lords of the admiralty, and freedom meant more to him than it did to anyone in the mountains.Maybe he seemed odd to the fraternity because he insisted on being called <i>Mister,</i> or maybe it was because of his burly barrel-shaped body, or the seaman's roll in his gait. Maybe it was because of his giant misshapen nose, which had suffered much pulping and pounding in innumerable brawls, a hogback that now dominated his face so that his small blue eyes and thin lips shrank to nothing in comparison. Or maybe it was his battered black top hat, pierced by arrow and shot, which he wore with determined dignity in all seasons, perched on a full mane of ragged brown hair that reached his shoulders.Or maybe they found him odd simply because he wasn't an American, and didn't speak the trapper lingo, and addressed others with politeness and civility, which were things he was born to and couldn't help. He was a man without a country; not able to return to England, yet not a westering man out of the States, so he lived in some sort of limbo, hisonly nation the trapping fraternity of the mountains--and his wife Victoria's people, the Crows.But he didn't mind. What counted was their respect as well as his own respect for himself, and what else they thought of him didn't matter. He had mastered the wilderness arts in a hurry. And never stopped learning how to subsist himself in a world where there was nary a shop on any corner to sell him beef or pork or bread or greens, and nary a tailor to sew him a suit of clothes, nary a smith to fashion a weapon, and nary a doctor to tend to his ills and aches and broken bones. He had mastered the Arkansas toothpick, the Green River knife, the Hawken percussion rifle, the war axe and throwing hatchet, the savage's bow and arrow, war club and lance because there were no constables in the wilds to protect him. He knew how to build a smokeless fire, how to read the behavior of crows and magpies, how to sense an ambush around a bend. He had graduated summa cum laude from the Rocky Mountain College, where one either won a baccalaureate or died in some obscure gulch, his fate unknown.So he, along with two hundred others, lingered in the verdant meadows where the Popo joined the Wind, awaiting whatever the lords of their fate in distant St. Louis had to offer. It was a sweet land, at least in summer, with cool evenings, and vast panoramas in which grassy benchlands surrendered to dark-timbered slopes, which in turn stretched upward in bright blue distances to snow-capped peaks that fairly cried "Freedom!"The blue haze of campfires lay in the air, and the pungent aroma of wood smoke. In addition to the trappers, the dusky tribesmen had gathered once again to trade their pelts for all those treasures brought from afar by the white men: powder and lead, blankets, hooks, traps, mirrors, beads, and especially, the trade whiskey the wily traders concocted and sold by the cup or jug for furs.Skye could see the tawny buffalo-hide lodges of the Crowsarrayed in a circle, and those of the Shoshones and Nez Perce, and some plenty of other tribes as well, dotting the verdant meadows. Here, on neutral trading ground, even hereditary enemies enjoyed a momentary peace, though they were all fair game for one another once they departed from the legendary trapper's fair.Skye waited restlessly, his eyes on the low divide that would someday soon reveal a string of heavily burdened pack horses and mules, and some gaudily bedizened mountaineers driving them into the rendezvous.He did not know what he would do if the news was bad, which is what he fully expected. There weren't enough beaver pelts in camp to pay for the enormous expense of shipping all those goods from St. Louis, much less earn anyone a profit. He had two skills: he was an able seaman, and could always ship out on any merchant vessel, and he was also an able mountaineer. He suspected he might just need to learn another trade, and he wasn't sure what it might be.His wife Victoria was visiting with all her friends and relatives, some of whom she saw only at these annual fairs. At rendezvous time, he often went for hours, even a day, without seeing her. But whenever they were together on the trail, leading a brigade, she and he scrubbed and cooked and hunted together, lived and loved together with a unity of purpose and spirit that transcended their radically different upbringings. They were friends and lovers, hunters and warriors, and boon companions upon life's sweet walk. Except when he was enjoying his annual binge. The thought made him thirsty.He was still young. He'd suffered hardship in the mountains, but his body was strong, and hardship had annealed the steel in him and wrought a man of rare courage and intelligence and something else: honor.Ten days passed, then eleven, and finally on the twelfth, Joe Meek, who had been scouting up the trail for news, returned with news: The American Fur Company pack train would arrivethe next day. From the crest of the ridge where he had observed the distant train, he could see it was a small one, poor doings compared to the outfits the company brought in during the heyday of the beaver trade. But an outfit, anyway, and maybe there would be a few casks of spirits on the backs of those mules to gladden the hearts and bodies of the trappers.So the next day, that June, Skye might learn his fate.Copyright � 2001 by Richard S.

For each, home meant something slightly different: a place of comfort in a rapidly evolving society, a sanctuary immune to changing fortune and fame, a simpler way of life away from the city, or a place to entertain and to express individual taste. All of the artists, however, made their homes a mainstay of their art.<br><br>Through this book we follow the artists' daily activities and routines&#x2014;working, dining, bathing, socializing, sleeping&#x2014;and come ever closer to the extraordinary characters behind the paintings. Here are Berthe Morisot's conversations with her cook; Degas' relationship with his devoted housekeeper; Monet's highly unconventional m�nage with his second wife; the lingering mood of pleasure at the end of a good meal, as reflected in Renoir's <i>Boatmen's Lunch</i>. The reader witnesses the birth of the modern world, with its telephones and central heating, and explores the relationships between the artists and their models, mistresses, wives, friends, families, patrons, dealers, doctors, gardeners, and children.<br><br>The extended Impressionist family includes the American "Givernistes" who gathered around Monet in his later life and Impressionist artists from other countries. All find their place, and the book is completed by biographies of the supporting characters and the locations of Impressionist homes for today's travelers. 180 illustrations in color and black and white.</p><p><b>Pamela Todd</b> studied history of art at the University of London.

Called &#x201c;[a] richly imagined saga of passion, suspense, and magic&#x201d; by <em>Time </em><em>Magazine, it is a haunting and remarkable tale told by an unforgettable, if strangely unreliable narrator&#x2014;a woman from an enigmatic Salem family who can foretell the future in patterns of lace. The Lace Reader </em><em>was a runaway New York Times </em><em>bestseller&#x2014;hitting the top lists in major cities across the country, from Boston to Chicago to Los Angeles&#x2014;and has immediately established debut author Brunonia Barry as a major force in contemporary American fiction.</em></p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, August 2008</b>: Brunonia Barry dreamt she saw a prophecy in a piece of lace, a vision so potent she spun it into a novel. The Lace Reader retains the strange magic of a vivid dream, though Barry's portrayal of modern-day Salem, Massachusetts--with its fascinating cast of eccentrics--is reportedly spot-on. Some of its stranger residents include generations of Whitney women, with a gift for seeing the future in the lace they make. Towner Whitney, back to Salem from self-imposed exile on the West Coast, has plans for recuperation that evaporate with her great-aunt Eva's mysterious drowning. Fighting fear from a traumatic adolescence she can barely remember, Towner digs in for answers. But questions compound with the disappearance of a young woman under the thrall of a local fire-and-brimstone preacher, whose history of violence against Whitney women makes the situation personal for Towner. Her role in cop John Rafferty's investigation sparks a tentative romance. And as they scramble to avert disaster, the past that had slipped through the gaps in Towner's memory explodes into the present with a violence that capsizes her concept of truth. Readers will look back at the story in a new light, picking out the clues in this complex, lovely piece of work. --<i>Mari Malcolm</i><blockquote><p>Every gift has a price . . .</p><p>Every piece of lace has a secret . . .</p><p>My name is Towner Whitney.

More and more local churches are convinced of the benefits and the necessity of having an organized small groups ministry. But how does one go about starting such a ministry? You know the old adage: &#x201c;If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.&#x201d; But how do you plan for something you&#x2019;ve never done before? How to Build a Small-Groups Ministry will walk you through the critical steps to planning and coordinating a successful program for small groups in your local church. This hands-on handbook includes three essential features: 1) Twelve logical steps for organizing and administrating a small groups ministry 2) A case study of a church in the process of implementing this plan 3) Worksheets for developing a plan for your own church Because each church situation is different, this workbook is designed to teach you basic principles that apply to all small groups and then help you adapt these principles to the particular needs and operational style of your local church.

Nelson, and Anita Nelson. Edited by Tom Pomplun.Grade 8 Up&#x2013;Doyle's prose and poetry are brought to life in this exciting volume. It has some overlap from the first volume (Eureka, 2002), but also includes some truly outstanding new tales. In The Ghosts of Goresthorpe Grange, a man believes that his house is occupied by spirits and seeks out the help of a medium. Ultimately, he is drugged and swindled, and the dreamlike style of the art reinforces this mood. In Two Great Brown-Pericord Motor, two men create an invention and become fiercely jealous and protective of it, until disaster erupts. This volume also contains two Sherlock Holmes stories and thrilling tales of sea adventures. Though each one is illustrated by a different artist, the writing ties the collection together nicely. Unlike the earlier volume, this one utilizes a consistent comic format throughout. The artists have deftly captured the themes and moods of each piece in the black-and-white illustrations done in a wide range of styles and techniques. This assortment of tales may attract new readers to Doyle's work.<i>&#x2013;Jennifer Feigelman, Plattekill Public Library, Modena, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Federal planners seeking an uncritical glorification of the nation's founding came up against an array of constituencies with other interests and objectives. Inspired by the "new social history" that looked at the past "from the bottom up," Americans who had previously been disenfranchised by traditional national narratives&#x2015;African Americans, women, American Indians, workers, young people&#x2015;demanded a voice and representation in the planning. Local communities, similarly suspicious of federal direction, sought control over their own bicentennial events. Corporate representatives promoted an approach that championed the convergence of patriotism and private enterprise, while commercial interests applied the marketing techniques of an expanding consumerism to hawk every imaginable kind of patriotic souvenir to all of these groups.<br><br>The end result of these competing efforts, Tammy S. Gordon shows, was a national celebration that reflected some common themes, including a mistrust of federal power, an embrace of decentralized authority, and a new cultural emphasis on the importance of the self. The American Revolution Bicentennial can thus be seen as both a product of the social and political changes of the 1960s and a harbinger of things to come. After 1976, the postwar myth of a consensus view of American history came to an end, ensuring that future national commemorations would continue to be contested.</p><p>Tammy S. Gordon is associate professor of history at the University of North Carolina Wilmington and author of <i>Private History in Public: Exhibition and the Settings of Everyday Life.</i>"An insightful piece of scholarship that raises important issues regarding the study of public uses of the past."&#x2015;John Bodnar, author of <i>Remaking America: Public Memory, Commemoration, and Patriotism in the Twentieth Century</i><br><br>"Illuminating . . .

Brown, an American who caters and does food consulting in London, was inspired by the city's array of ethnic eateries, and much of the book is filtered through recent immigrants or British cooks who have become skilled in another region's cooking style; the "expert" on Spanish cooking, for example, is a Bristol chef, and many recipes are adapted from other cookbooks, perhaps less authentic as a result. Brown makes up for this by including numerous dishes that will pleasantly surprise vegetarians who think they've tried everything, such as delightful Coriander Pea Cakes in Coconut Curry from Mauritius; cute, fried Son-in-Law Eggs from Thailand; and a thick, hot Ukrainian variation on Borshch. Most are main dishes, and familiar offerings (Boston Baked Beans; Moroccan Mixed Vegetable Couscous) anchor the 11 chapters, which span the world by region. Few of the recipes are complicated, and Brown provides conversions and translations for measurements and terms, though beginners may be frustrated by the sometimes vague instructions. Still, with its beautiful presentation of a well-rounded selection of dishes, this book should take a prominent place on the shelf of any vegetarian who loves to cook.

She has written four books for children including Unusual Day, published by Young Corgi in 1996.<b>Overture and Beginners<br>Time: April 1940<br>Place: Copenhagen, Denmark </b><br><br>The day the Germans invaded I was asleep on Henry V's throne. It was 1940. I was ten and I was asleep on the throne in the middle of the stage at the Royal Copenhagen Theatre. I suppose it made it all seem even more dramatic. The real King Henry, of course, had been dead for a long time but I had seen my Uncle Max play him so often that I dreamed about Henry and his great battles. I imagined I was making wonderful speeches calling the soldiers to cry 'God for Harry, England and Saint George!' I knew the words:<br><br><i>. . . when the blast of war blows in our ears,<br>Then imitate the action of the tiger.<br></i><br>I had heard the speech a million times from the wings of the theatre. It was stirring stuff, even for a small Danish boy.<br><br>That night, 9 April, there had been a big party on the stage. All the actors had done little scenes and everyone had wept when my mother did her piece from <i>Hamlet</i> where the queen says that poor, mad Ophelia has drowned herself in the river. Even Torvald the comic cried and said Mama could move an onion to weep. Mama had bowed low and still for a moment and there was this tremendous hush. She knew she had everyone in the palm of her hand because she looked at me and winked. Then she stood up and gave the tinkling laugh that got such good reviews in her production of <i>A Doll's House</i>. It was as if all the sad bits had been a great joke and everyone felt better immediately. Remembering to laugh when things were bad was what Mama did best.<br><br>Father had painted a little congratulations card for everyone, with the red-and-white flags of Denmark spelling out their names. Thomas, who was wardrobe master, had provided fancy dress and there were kings and clowns, cowboys and Indians, courtiers and peasants, ballet dancers and stilt walkers and even two men from the electrics crew dressed as a cow. Thomas had found me a top hat and waistcoat and said I could be 'the little ringmaster'. I don't know what I must have looked like in the huge hat and my usual baggy grey shorts which came to my knee, but I thought it was great getting dressed up. The old season was over and everyone needed to relax a little. Soon there would be new plays, with hours of rehearsal and lots of tension and excitement, but for now it was time to have fun.<br><br>I loved the theatre and everything about it: the dusty smell, the old wooden boards where anything could happen, the excitement, the nerves, the showing off and the fun. From my mother I learned to love it when the place was full and the audience was hushed. My mother was an actress through and through. My father was in the theatre too but he was a designer and painter. From him I learned how wonderful it could be when the stage was empty, waiting for the next great set to be put up: that moment when the theatre could become anything from a sailing ship to a Bedouin desert. My father would stand on the stage and show me the drawings of the world he wanted to build.<br><br>'Look, Bamse,' he would say. 'Just imagine where we will take everyone next time.' He and I would stand there and create magic with his paints and brushes and imagination.<br><br>We lived in a make-believe world and it was hard for me to imagine doing anything else with my life. My mother was not just any actress. She was one of the most famous women in Denmark. She was what the Danish critics called 'a leading light'. Elegant and beautiful, she was brilliant at Chekhov, at comedy and, of course, at Shakespeare. Mama and Papa had met on stage and I had been hanging around the theatre since Mama had first carried me on in a music revue as the brand-new baby of a girl who had got into trouble. Then there was Uncle Max (who was not my real uncle but my godfather). Uncle Max was a wonderful actor and he and Mama had played every famous couple there was in the theatre. I sometimes think the audience thought they were married in real life, they were so good together. They could make you cry and laugh at the same moment. Maybe that's why we were so good at it once the war came.<br><br>On the night of the big party no one had been talking about politics. There was a war going on in Europe but so far Denmark had been left alone. I don't remember being afraid, even though in those days I was sometimes fearful of other things and slept with a light on. After everyone had done their party pieces we all sang old Danish songs. The Danes love singing and Uncle Max had written some new words specially for that night, making jokes and poking fun at everyone. My big brother Orlando, who was sixteen, and my fourteen-year-old sister Masha had gone home but I hid out of the way so as not to catch Mama's eye and make her realize how late it was. I had watched the grown-ups laughing and drinking beer. Then Thomas had put me on the throne and made me deliver one of Henry's speeches and everyone had clapped. I had fallen asleep on the throne with the sound still ringing in my ears.<br><br>When I awoke in the morning I wasn't sure where I was. The electricians had gone home. Perhaps they had walked through the streets of Copenhagen still dressed as a cow. A drunk cow heading home. Even at a party the backstage people never last as long as the actors. The men had turned out the lights except for the one safety lamp that always burns night and day in every theatre in the world. Now the whole stage was lit with a single bulb on a stand in the corner. The music had stopped but I wasn't alone. There were various sleeping bodies about the place, and Kaufmann, who played the piano for the sketches, seemed to have collapsed across the keyboard. None of the slumbering shapes looked like Mother or Father but I wasn't afraid. This was my home.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Celebrating the Inner Beauty of Women</h2><p>In this warm and endearing gift book, bestselling author Janette Oke takes her readers on a new journey, to a place where the softer side of a woman is celebrated, where the qualities that portray women&#39;s strength, love, kindness, compassion, devotion, and tenderness are woven together through touching insights from one of the most beloved storytellers.

You already know David as the legendary warrior king of Israel, husband of Bathsheba, and father of Solomon; now meet David as he really was: the cocky Jewish kid, the plagiarized poet, and the Jewish father. Listen as David tells his own story, a story both relentlessly ancient and surprisingly modern, about growing up and growing old, about men and women, and about man and God. It is quintessential Heller.</p><p>Joseph Heller was born in Brooklyn in 1923. In 1961, he published <i>Catch-22</i>, which became a bestseller and, in 1970, a film. He went on to write such novels as <i>Good as Gold, God Knows, Picture This, Closing Time</i>, and <i>Portrait of an Artist, as an Old Man</i>. Heller died in 1999.</p><h2>The Character Factory</h2><p>Describes the origins of scouting in Edwardian England, and explains the reasons why Baden-Powell established the Boy Scouts</p><p>Both of these titles assess the societal ethos that Victorian/Edwardian Eng land "manufactured" in its efforts to maintain imperial sanctity (and momen tum) in a rapidly changing world. Man gan's thesis is that public school team sports shaped the values required for global management. He describes many of the schools in England and the Empire which utilized the playing field to develop loyalty, self-reliance, obedi ence, and initiative in those who were charged with assuming "the white man's burden" and transmitting re sponsible behavior to the colonized populations. Though sometimes rather repetitive and superficial, his is an in teresting, informative study. Rosenthal has prepared a first-rate account of Robert Baden Powell's great invention, the Boy Scouts. He skillfully demonstrates that the organization's overriding purpose was to develop tra ditional British virtues, e.g., honor, self-sacrifice, and discipline, among so ciety's less-privileged classesvirtues that Baden-Powell considered essential for the perpetuation of England and Empire. The book is a sheer delight. Witty, probing, and perceptive, it clear ly documents the "Chief Scout's" vi sion of scouting as a universal panacea. Most libraries should consider Man gan's book; all should consider Rosen thal's. Mark R. Yerburgh, Trinity Coll .

Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, argues that today&#x2019;s government is stuck in the last century while&#x2014;in both the private sector and our personal lives&#x2014;absolutely everything else has changed. The explosion of social media, the evolution of Internet commerce, the ubiquity of smart phones that can access all the world&#x2019;s information; in the face of these extraordinary advances, our government appears increasingly irrelevant and out of touch.<br><br>Drawing on wide-ranging interviews with thinkers and politicians, Newsom&#x2019;s <i>Citizenville </i>shows how Americans can transform their government, taking matters into their own hands to dissolve political gridlock even as they produce tangible changes in the real world. When local Web designers wanted to prevent muggings in Chicago and Oakland, they created innovative crime-mapping tools using public police data. When congressional representatives wanted citizens&#x2019; input on new legislation, they used interactive blogging tools to invite public comments and changes. When a town in Texas needed to drum up civic engagement, officials invented a local digital &#x201c;currency&#x201d; to reward citizens for participating in government&#x2014;making small-town politics suddenly as fun and addictive as online games such as Farmville. Surveying the countless small advances made by ordinary Americans in reinventing government for the twenty-first century, Newsom unveils a path for American prosperity and democratic vitality.<br><br>Newsom explains how twenty-first-century problems are too big and too expensive for the government simply to buy solutions; instead, Americans must innovate their way out. Just as the post office and the highway system provide public infrastructure to channel both personal and private enterprise&#x2014;a platform upon which citizens can grow&#x2014;so too could a modern digital government house the needs, concerns, information, and collaboration of an enlightened digital citizenry.<br><br>A vision for better government that truly achieves the ancient goal of commonwealth and a triumphant call for individuals to reinvigorate the country with their own two hands, <i>Citizenville</i> is a timely road map for restoring American prosperity and for reinventing citizenship in today&#x2019;s networked age.</p><p>GAVIN NEWSOM is the forty-ninth lieutenant governor of the State of California, following two terms as mayor of San Francisco.

The answer depends on the amount and properties of matter in the universe, and that has given rise to one of the great paradoxes of modern cosmology: there is too little visible matter to account for the behavior we can see. Over ninety percent of the universe consists of &#x201d;missing mass&#x201d; or &#x201d;dark matter&#x201d; - what Lawrence Krauss, in his classic book, termed &#x201d;the fifth essence.&#x201d;In this new edition of T <i>he Fifth Essence</i> , retitled <i>Quintessence</i> after the now widely accepted term for dark matter, Krauss shows how the dark matter problem is now connected with two of the hottest areas in recent cosmology: the fate of the universe and the &#x201d;cosmological constant.&#x201d; With a new introduction, epilogue, and chapter updates, Krauss updates his classic for 1999 and shares one of the most stunning discoveries of recent years: an anti-gravity force that explains recent observations of a permanently expanding universe.</p><p>Lawrence M.

Suddenly Nick's name is on her lips...his hands on her thighs...dark hair and eyes called back from the swirling gray of purgatory's depths.<br><br>Dead, alive, or something in between, they can't stop their hunger.<br><br>She wouldn't dare.<br><br></p><p>Megan Hart is the award-winning and multi-published author of more than thirty novels, novellas and short stories.

Twenty years ago, Bess Walsh had stood on this beach and looked forward to the rest of her life, and now...<br><br>Now she wasn't sure she was ready for what lay ahead.<br><br>Now she stood with cold sand scraping her toes and the salt-scented air tangling her hair. She breathed deep. She shut out the night with the darkness behind her eyelids and lost herself in the past so she didn't have to think about the future.<br><br>The night air in late May still held a chill, especially this close to the water, and her thin T-shirt and denim skirt didn't provide much warmth. Her nipples peaked, and she crossed her arms to hug some heat into herself. It seemed appropriate to shiver, remembering that long-ago summer. Remembering him. For twenty years she'd tried to forget, yet here she was, back again, and unable to forget any more than she ever had.<br><br>Bess tipped her face to the breeze that pushed her hair from her face. She opened her mouth to drink it in, to eat it like some sweet candy. The smell filled her nose and coated her tongue. It took her back more effectively than mere memory could. Transported her.<br><br>Silly. She was too old to entertain fairy tales. Time travel didn't exist. There was no way to go back. No way, even, to stay where she was. Her only option, anybody's only option, was to move forward.<br><br>Thinking this, she did move forward. One step, then another. Her feet sank into the sand and she cast a glance over her shoulder to the safety of her deck and the single candle burning there. The wind pushed the flame into flickers and she waited for it to go out, but it stayed lit within the protection of its glass container.<br><br>Back then, that house had stood apart. Now neighbors flanked it, close enough to hit if you spat in the right direction, as her grandma would have said. The house behind, four stories of million-dollar architecture, loomed over hers. Now seagrass-dotted dunes that hadn't been there twenty years ago swelled between the houses and the beach, and though a few lights shone in windows farther down the sand, closer to the main square of Bethany Beach, this early in the season most of the houses near hers were dark.<br><br>The water would be too cold for swimming. Great whites could be lurking. The undertow would be strong. Bess went to the water anyway, drawn by memory and desire.<br><br>The ocean had always made her more aware of her body and its cycles. The push and pull of the tide had seemed such a feminine thing, tied as it was to the moon. She never swam in it, but being around the sea always made Bess feel more sensual and alive, like a cat wanting to rub up against a friendly hand. The warm waters of the Bahamas, the cold Atlantic waves of Maine, the smooth, rippling Gulf of Mexico, the gorgeous blue waters of the Pacific, had all called to her, but none of them so strongly as this patch of water and sand. This place.<br><br>Twenty years later, it was stronger than ever.<br><br>Her feet found the hard-packed sand the last wave had left behind. She curled her toes into the chill. Now and then a glimmer ofwhite foam appeared, but nothing touched her yet. She took a dragging step, letting her feet guide her so she didn't come down unexpectedly on a sharp stone or shell. Another step forward led her to even wetter sand. Squishy again. The rush and roar ofthe water threw up spray into the breeze, and she opened her mouth for it the way she had the scent.<br><br>The water, when at last it touched her feet, wasn't cold. The warmth was more shocking than a chill would've been, and Bess gasped. Before she took another step, another wave came. Warmth swirled around her ankles and splashed up her bare legs. It pulled away, leaving her feet buried. She went deeper without thinking. Step by step, until the water, as warm as a bath, as warm as a kiss, bathed her thighs. It soaked the hem of her skirt and splashed onto her shirt.<br><br>Laughing, Bess bent to let the water flow over her hands, her wrists. Elbows. It rolled under her touch, evading her grasp. She knelt, soaking herself in the waves.<br><br>They touched her like a thousand kisses all over her at once. Like tongues licking. Splashing higher, wetting her panties. Water covered her to the waist when she sat. Moved up over her throat when she lay back. It covered her face and she held her breath, waiting for it to retreat.<br><br>Her hair came loose, but Bess thought nothing of losing the clip that had bound it. Like seaweed, her hair swirled, tickling her bare arms and covering her face, only to be washed away by the next wave. Salt and the grit of sand painted her lips when she licked them, opened them as if for a lover's kiss. She spread out her arms, but the water wouldn't be held. Salt stung her eyes, but not from the sea. From her tears, sliding unbidden across her cheeks. They tasted bitter, not like the fish-sand-salt sweetness of the ocean.<br><br>Bess opened herself up to the water and the waves. To the past. Every time the surge came she held her breath, wondering if this next time would be the one to take her by surprise and fill her lungs with water. Or to pull her deeper, under. And she wondered what she would do if that happened. If she would care. If she would fight or let the sea take her away, if she would give up and be lost in it the way she had once been lost in him.<br><br>They'd made love on this beach with the sound of the ocean masking their cries. He'd used his mouth and hands to make her writhe. She'd slid his cock inside her to anchor their bodies, but no matter how many times they'd fucked, it hadn't worked. Pleasure didn't last. Everything ended.<br><br>Her own hands were a poor substitute, but Bess used them anyway. Sand rasped her fingertips as she slid them beneath her shirt to cup her breasts, remembering how his mouth had felt. Lower, how his hands had moved between her thighs. She parted her legs, letting the sea stroke her the way he once had. Her hips lifted, pushing against something that didn't push back. The water retreated, swirling, exposing her to the night-chilled air.<br><br>More waves came to embrace her as she caressed herself. It had been a long time since she'd taken this pleasure, done this alone. She hadn't made love to herself in so long her hands felt like someone else's.<br><br>He hadn't been her first lover or the first boy to give her an orgasm. He hadn't even been the first she'd loved. He'd been the first to turn her inside out with something as simple as a smile. The first to make her doubt herself. He'd taken her deeper than anyone ever had, and yet she hadn't drowned.<br><br>The affair had been short. A page in the book of her life, barely a chapter. Only one verse of the song. She'd spent more years without him than she had with him. None of that mattered, either.<br><br>When Bess touched herself, it was his smile she imagined. His voice, murmuring her name. His fingers linked with hers. His body. His touch. His name.<br><br>"Nick." The single word slipped off her tongue for the first time in twenty years, unlocked by the sea. This sea. This sand. This beach. This place.<br><br><em>Nick.</em><br><br>The hand that closed over her ankle was as warm as the water, and for a moment Bess thought a hank of seaweed had wrapped itself around her. A moment later another hand touched her other foot. Both slid up her legs, to her thighs. The weight and heat of a body, solid and not like the water, covered her. She'd opened her mouth to the sea as if accepting a lover, but now a real kiss claimed her. Real lips, real hands, a real tongue plunged into her mouth and stroked hers.<br><br>She should have screamed at this invasion. At this dark stranger's sudden violation. Yet this was no stranger's touch. She knew it better than she knew her own. The weight of his hands. The shape of his cock. The taste of him.<br><br>It was fantasy, memory. It was wishful thinking. Bess didn't care. She opened herself to him the way she had to the water. Tomorrow when the sun rose and her skin chafed from the sand's abuse she would call herself a fool, but here and now her desire was too strong to deny. She didn't want to deny it. She'd tossed caution aside then, and she did so now.<br><br>His hand went beneath her head to cradle it. His mouth covered hers, nibbling, before his tongue plunged again into her mouth. His moan vibrated her lips. His fingers threaded through her hair.<br><br>"Bess," he said, and then more. The sorts of things lovers said in the heat of their passion, words that didn't hold up under scrutiny.<br><br>She didn't care. Bess slid her hands down Nick's back to the familiar rounded curves of his ass. He wore denim and she pushed it down until he was naked, his skin hot. She traced the ditch ofhis spine with her fingers as his kiss claimed her. Water splashed and retreated, no longer rising high enough to cover them.<br><br>His hand slid between her legs and pulled at her panties. The thin material gave way at once. He pushed her skirt up to her hips. Her shirt was so thin and so wet it was as though she wore nothing. When his mouth clamped over one turgid nipple, Bess cried out and arched. His fingers found the heat between her legs. He rubbed, and her body jerked. She was ready.<br><br>"Bess," Nick said into her ear. "What is this?"<br><br>"Don't ask," she told him. She pulled his mouth back to hers. Beneath her, wet sand cradled them. She dug her heels into it and opened her thighs. She reached between them to grab his cock, the thick heat of it as familiar as everything else. "Don't ask, Nick, or it might all go away."<br><br>She stroked him gently, too mindful ofthe salt and sand to urge him to enter her. Not even in fantasy could she forget the agony of sand in places it didn't belong. The memory of it, of how they'd both walked bowlegged from it, made her laugh aloud.<br><br>Bess laughed again as Nick's mouth fastened on her throat. His hands roamed. The two of them writhed together, rolling in the wet sand. He laughed in turn, tipping back his head. In the faint starlight he looked no different than he ever had.<br><br>His hand moved slowly between her legs, but it was enough. Bess tensed, her fingers digging into the smooth muscles ofhis back. She bit back her cry as a climax filled her. Nick grunted, hips thrusting forward against her. Heat spurted against her belly, bared by his touch, and the sea smell grew briefly stronger.<br><br>Nick bent his face to her shoulder, holding her tight. The water tickled her feet but came no higher. His body, naked and smooth, covered her.<br><br>The sea had brought him to her, a fact Bess accepted without question. Without hesitation. None of this would be real in the daylight. It wouldn't be real even the moment she left the water and stumbled, soaking, to her bed. None of this was real, but all of it was, and she didn't question it for fear it would all go away.<br><em>Then</em><br><br>#34;You sure you don't want a hit?" Missy waved the joint in Bess's direction, sending a cloud of fragrant smoke to tickle her nostrils. "C'mon, Bessie. It's a party."<br><br>"Bessie is a cow's name." Bess flipped the other girl the finger and cracked the top on a can of soda. "And, no, I don't need your weed, thanks."<br><br>"Suit yourself." She drew deep and coughed, destroying her carefully wrought illusion that she was some sort of druggie queen. "That's some good shit!"<br><br>Bess rolled her eyes and eyed the bowl of potato chips on Missy's coffee table. "How long have those been there?"<br><br>She coughed again. "I just put them out, bitch. Right before you got here."<br><br>Bess pulled the bowl closer and checked them carefully. Missy's trailer was consistently filthy. Seeing no bugs or garbage even when she tipped the bowl from side to side, Bess took a chance. She was starving.<br><br>"Christ, I could go for a pizza." Missy flopped onto the battered armchair and hung her legs over the side. The bottoms of her feet were dark with dirt. Her skirt rode up, flashing a hint of hot-pink lace. "Let's get a pizza"<br><br>"I have exactly two dollars to last me until payday." Bess crunched chips and swallowed them down with store-brand cola that had already lost its fizz.<br><br>Missy waved a languorous hand. "So I'll call some guys. Make them bring the pizza."<br><br>Before Bess had time to protest, Missy sat up with a grin and tossed her bleached-blond hair over her shoulder. The motion caused one unfettered breast to surge out of her tank top. Missy was built like a brick shit house, as she was fond of saying, and didn't mind showing it off.<br><br>"C'mon," she said, as if Bess <em>was</em> protesting, though she hadn't even opened her mouth. "It'll be a party. Who doesn't like a party? Well, besides you."<br><br>"I like parties." Bess leaned back against the couch Missy had stolen from outside the Salvation Army. "But I have to work tomorrow."<br><br>"Shit. So do I. So what? Let's have a fucking party, okay?" Missy jumped off the chair and settled her joint in the overflowing ashtray. "It'll be fun. You need some fun in you, Bess."<br><br>"I have fun!"<br><br>Missy rolled her eyes. "I know what kind of fun you have. I'm talking about some real fun. Get some color in those cheeks. And I don't mean the ones on your face."<br><br>"Nice." Bess laughed, even though Missy's assessment of her wasn't entirely flattering. How could she not? Missy had a way about her that didn't allow Bess to take her too seriously. "So you're going to call some boys and tell them to bring pizza. And they'll just do it."<br><br>Missy lifted the hem of her teensy-weensy skirt and flashed her tiny pink panties. "Of course they will"<br><br>"I'm not screwing some guy for pizza, no matter how hungry I am." Bess put her feet up on the coffee table without taking off her flip-flops. She would never have done that at home, God no, even in bare feet. Missy didn't seem to care. Or notice.<br><br>"What do I care who you screw?" She was already dialing the phone as she rummaged in the fridge for a beer.

The foundationless stone pillars shriek and the earth beneath them heaves under the structure&#x2019;s weight as the Dean&#x2019;s will weighs down his collapsing faith.<br></p><p>Born in Cornwall, England, William Golding started writing at the age of seven. Though he studied natural sciences at Oxford to please his parents, he also studied English and published his first book, a collection of poems, before finishing college. He served in the Royal Navy during World War II, participating in the Normandy invasion. Golding&#39;s other novels include Lord of the Flies, The Inheritors, The Spire, Rites of Passage (Booker Prize), and The Double Tongue.In the 14th century, when men broke their backs and lost their lives toiling with stone to build the great cathedrals, Den Jocelin is visited by an angel who tells him to erect a spire upon a building that has no foundations. Despised as a lunatic and self-deceiver, Jocelin's will forces the spire upwards, course by course, until the pillars begin to sing and the earth to crawl. Golding's exposition of one man's struggle with the noble and ignoble sides of his nature confirmed him in 1964 as a writer of fantastic imaginative power, and the magic of this book is still extraordinarily potent to me today. (<i>Kirkus (UK)</i>)</p><h2>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</h2><p>Charlie is a shy and introspective boy, a wallflower always standing on the edge of the action. We learn about him through the letters he writes to someone of an undisclosed name, age and gender.</p><p>What is most notable about this funny, touching, memorable first novel from Stephen Chbosky is the resounding accuracy with which the author captures the voice of a boy teetering on the brink of adulthood. Charlie is a freshman. And while's he's not the biggest geek in the school, he is by no means popular. He's a wallflower--shy and introspective, and intelligent beyond his years, if not very savvy in the social arts. We learn about Charlie through the letters he writes to someone of undisclosed name, age, and gender, a stylistic technique that adds to the heart-wrenching earnestness saturating this teen's story. Charlie encounters the same struggles that many kids face in high school--how to make friends, the intensity of a crush, family tensions, a first relationship, exploring sexuality, experimenting with drugs--but he must also deal with his best friend's recent suicide. Charlie's letters take on the intimate feel of a journal as he shares his day-to-day thoughts and feelings: <p> </p><blockquote> I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why. </blockquote> With the help of a teacher who recognizes his wisdom and intuition, and his two friends, seniors Samantha and Patrick, Charlie mostly manages to avoid the depression he feels creeping up like kudzu. When it all becomes too much, after a shocking realization about his beloved late Aunt Helen, Charlie retreats from reality for awhile. But he makes it back in due time, ready to face his sophomore year and all that it may bring. Charlie, sincerely searching for that feeling of "being infinite," is a kindred spirit to the generation that's been slapped with the label X. <i>--Brangien Davis</i>Stephen Chbosky grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the University of Southern California&#39;s Filmic Writing Program.

For these crimes, Liz Phair was run out of her hometown of Chicago, enduring a flame war perpetrated by writers who accused her of being boring, inauthentic, and even a poor musician. </p><p>With <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, Phair spoke for all the girls who loved the world of indie rock but felt deeply unwelcome there. Like all great works of art, <i>Exile</i> was a harbinger of the shape of things to come: Phair may have undermined the male ego, but she also unleashed a new female one. For the sake of all the female artists who have benefited from her work&#x2015;from Sleater-Kinney to Lana Del Rey and back again&#x2015;it's high time we go back to Guyville.</p></p><p><p><b>Gina Arnold</b> is the author of <i>Route 666: On the Road to Nirvana</i> and <i>Kiss This: Punk in the Present Tense</i>.

Doing so in the context of one record makes the task even more difficult. I can say, having reviewed many scholarly articles in my time, that Arnold passes the test with flying colors. The book is well cited, filled (but not overwrought) with pertinent facts, and her points are structured in a way that just make sense. In a word, the book is smart.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>2bit Monkey</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gina Arnold's book on Liz Phair's 1993 double LP, <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, is the kind of book that weighs in, pulls no punches, and shines a light on the entire enterprise of popular music.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Paul Gleason, Caught in the Carousel</i></p><p>&#x201c;I found this book to be, like Ms. Phair's album, charming and brave and unexpectedly moving. The author is excellent on so many things, including how the power of Ms. Phair's songs grows from their grainy details, quotidian observations that other rockers so rarely give us, about things like housework and roommates and 'what is was like to feel voiceless and powerless in a nightclub, on a road trip, or during sexual intercourse.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dwight Garner, The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Arnold is a wonderful writer: fearless, precise, full of doubt, never taking anything for granted. She&#x2019;s one of the few people left on the planet who uses presently correctly, which can create its own thrill. Going back to Liz Phair&#x2019;s once notorious, now often forgotten, absurdly in-your-face ambitious first album&#x2015;"a story about a girl and a time and a place," the indie-rock world of Wicker Park, in Chicago, in the early 1990s, but in Phair&#x2019;s hands a story told with such heart that you need no such details to catch every shade of meaning and emotion&#x2015;Arnold has written a book about the past ("when dinosaurs, as personified by Dinosaur Jr., ruled the earth"), its follies and crimes ("Every past is worth condemning," Arnold quotes Nietzsche, and then puts the words to work), and the idea of an imagined community that the past leaves behind ("Often I think I am a better informed citizen of Middlemarch, Bartsetshire," Arnold says, "than I am of San Francisco"). And it&#x2019;s about what it means for a young woman to simultaneously take on both everyone in her town and take down the album that sums up everything that everyone in her town would like to sound like, look like, act like, be&#x2015;to take down a whole way of being in the world. "At one point we had felt like misfits or we had felt like &#x2018;others,&#x2019;" Carrie Brownstein recently said of the time she shared with Phair&#x2015;in her case, in her own indie-rock community, in Olympia, Washington. "It was supposed to be come one, come all, you know? Freaks gather round and we&#x2019;ll provide you with shelter. And you get in these scenes and you realize, no, I&#x2019;ve gone from one set of rules and regulations and codifications of how you should dress and what you should know to another...

His brief remarks over, with a couple of hundred workers, guests, and tourists watching, Stoltenberg unveiled a bust carved in ice, placed atop a waist-high column: &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the man!&#x201d; <br>The ice sculpture bore the likeness of Stoltenberg&#x2019;s legendary countryman Roald Amundsen. The low-key ceremony at the bottom of the world marked the centenary of Amundsen and four mates arriving at the South Pole on December 14, 1911, delivering historic glory to the young nation of Norway, which had become independent from Sweden a mere six years earlier. Fueled by relentless determination and aided by dogsleds, Amundsen&#x2019;s team famously beat the ill-fated expedition led by the British naval officer Robert Falcon Scott by nearly five weeks, scoring what was undoubtedly a remarkable feat of terrestrial exploration. <br>Today the frozen wasteland where the fierce competition between Amundsen and Scott played out, with the pride of nations and the lives of heroes at stake, is a hotbed of activity for a different breed of explorers with more ethereal goals. Intrepid bands of scientists racing to unravel mysteries of life, our planet, and the universe are the ones laying claim to Antarctica now. In fact, the continent crawls with well over a thousand scientists and support personnel during the summer months. Geologists dig up ice cores and track the movements of glaciers for clues about climate change. Atmospheric scientists fly helium-filled balloons to measure stratospheric ozone, to complement the observations of satellites staring down from space. Paleontologists forage for fossils of creatures that were wiped out by the deadliest of known extinctions 250 million years ago. Biologists scour the dry valleys of Antarctica in search of organisms that thrive in extreme habitats. In early 2012, after many years of drilling, Russian researchers pierced through two miles of ice to reach Lake Vostok, a pristine subglacial reservoir shielded from sunlight and the wind for some 20 million years; they had hopes of encountering hitherto unknown life-forms. <br>Two years earlier, I got to experience what it was like to live and work on the ice when I went to Antarctica as a member of a meteorite-collecting expedition. We reached McMurdo Station, the American research center on the coast located near Scott&#x2019;s 1902 landing site, by military transport plane from New Zealand. After a week of preparations, packing, and training, we then flew to a seasonal base camp, where, two by two, we boarded a Twin Otter plane on skis for the final leg of our journey. The small aircraft, operated by Canadian bush pilots, dropped us off on a remote ice field just five degrees from the Pole. That&#x2019;s where eight of us&#x2014;two women and six men&#x2014;camped out in yellow, pyramid-shaped &#x201c;Scott tents&#x201d; for the next five bone-chilling weeks, cut off from the rest of the world except for a satellite telephone and the occasional drop-off of mail and supplies. This being the Antarctic summer, the Sun was always up, tracing a counterclockwise circle in the sky every twenty-four hours. There was no sign of life&#x2014;human, animal, or plant&#x2014;to be seen anywhere. <br>Day after day, if the winds were bearable, we went out on snowmobiles or on foot to search the nearby vast ice field and the moraines next to the hills for rocks that had fallen from space. Wrapped in big red parkas as well as thermal layers, bunny boots, neck warmers, gloves, goggles, balaclavas, and hats, we took care to avoid frostbite and crevasses during our excursions. It was easy to slip and fall on the rock-hard ice and hurt yourself badly. I slid off the Ski-Doo once, but thankfully the thick parka cushioned my fall. Others on the team also had minor mishaps, but we survived the cold, the tedium, and the isolation without any serious problems. In fact, we enjoyed the stark beauty of the landscape&#x2014;the views from the tops of rocky peaks were especially magnificent&#x2014;and found ways to entertain ourselves. By the expedition&#x2019;s end, our team had collected a total of 900 meteorites, which are now available to researchers from around the world for a variety of studies. Our own reward was the remarkable experience itself&#x2014;and the delightful Ad�lie and emperor penguins we encountered near McMurdo at the end of the season. My one regret is that I didn&#x2019;t get to visit the South Pole, despite being so close to it. <br>The focus of activity at the Pole itself is decidedly extraterrestrial. These scientists seem to have taken to heart Marcel Proust&#x2019;s adage that &#x201c;the only true voyage of discovery&nbsp;&#x2026; would not be to travel to new lands, but to possess other eyes.&#x201d; The most striking part of their apparatus near the Pole is a 10-meter (33-foot) radio dish turned skyward, to map the feeble afterglow of the big bang. One of my Toronto colleagues, Keith Vanderlinde, spent most of the year 2008 taking care of this telescope; he survived the polar &#x201c;night&#x201d; that lasted for six months, temperatures that dipped to minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the overwhelming sense of isolation, not to mention the short showers and the severe boredom. But the most ambitious, and unconventional, of the scientific instruments near the South Pole is buried permanently deep under the ice, and it looks down, not up. Its construction&#x2014;or burial, to be more accurate&#x2014;was completed just a year before the Amundsen centennial celebration. All that the visiting dignitaries could see aboveground was a rectangular office trailer on stilts, filled with cables and computers. There was little sign of what lay beneath but for the small flags that scientists had planted helpfully on the ice to mark its mammoth footprint. <br>IceCube is an observatory like no other. The glacial ice itself, transparent and cleared of air bubbles by extreme pressure at depths greater than a mile, serves the same purpose as the smooth primary mirror of a conventional astronomical telescope. Buried in it are 86 long steel cables standing vertically, with 60 basketball-size globes hanging on each at regular intervals. Every one of the 5,160 globes contains optical sensors and electronics. The sensors, called phototubes, act like lightbulbs in reverse: they collect light and generate electric signals. In the case of IceCube, these sensors scrutinize the subterranean ice for faint blue flashes that occasionally shimmer in the dark stillness. Whenever a sensor detects a flash, it sends a signal to computers on the surface. <br>The blue flickers mark the passage of elementary particles known as muons, which belong to the same family as electrons but are about two hundred times more massive. By combining signals from the different nodes of this deeply buried sensor network, physicists can trace a muon&#x2019;s path in 3-D. But the researchers are not after the muons themselves. They are hunting for neutrinos, by far the most elusive and the weirdest of all known denizens of the subatomic world. These ghostly particles interact every once in a while with protons within ice molecules to release muons, thus betraying their presence as the muons in turn light up the ice. Since a newly created muon travels through ice along the same path as the incoming neutrino did, researchers can tell which direction the neutrino came from by examining the muon&#x2019;s trail. <br>Neutrinos are elementary particles, just like electrons that buzz about atomic nuclei or quarks that combine to make protons and neutrons. They are fundamental building blocks of matter, but they don&#x2019;t remain trapped inside atoms. Also unlike their subatomic cousins, neutrinos carry no electric charge, have a tiny mass, and hardly ever interact with other particles. A typical neutrino can travel through a light-year&#x2019;s worth of lead without interacting with any atoms. Therein lies the snag: neutrinos are pathologically shy. Their severe reluctance to mingle makes these particles hard to pin down, so neutrino hunting is a tricky business. But every so often, a neutrino does collide with something, such as a proton inside a water molecule, essentially by accident. It is to raise the odds of accidental collisions, and thus to increase our chances of observing neutrinos, that scientists build extremely large detectors like IceCube. <br>You still can&#x2019;t see neutrinos directly, but you can get a whiff of their presence from the clues they leave behind. On the rare occasions that neutrinos <i>do</i> interact with matter, they produce charged particles such as muons that physicists can detect with their instruments. But distinguishing neutrino signals from unrelated &#x201c;noise&#x201d; poses a challenge: cosmic rays, fast-moving particles that arrive from deep space, also produce muons, which might be confused with muons produced by neutrino interactions. Neutrino hunters place their equipment deep underground, or under a thick layer of ice, so that cosmic ray muons cannot get through. As Janet Conrad of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology explains, &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re trying to listen to a whisper, you don&#x2019;t want a lot of noise around.&#x201d; <br>Neutrinos are hard to catch, but they are also among the &#x201c;most wanted&#x201d; of all cosmic messengers for the secrets they hold about the nature of matter, the pyrotechnics of exploding stars, and the structure of the universe itself. Besides, in the words of theorist Boris Kayser of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) near Chicago, which is home to several neutrino experiments, &#x201c;If neutrinos didn&#x2019;t exist, we wouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#x201d; He explains that &#x201c;the Sun produces energy through nuclear reactions on which life on Earth depends, and those reactions could not occur without neutrinos.&#x201d; Moreover, the nuclear burning in previous generations of stars, which produced the heavy elements necessary for life, would not have been possible without neutrinos, either. Therefore, he argues that &#x201c;to make sense of the universe we need to understand neutrinos well.&#x201d; <br>Thankfully, neutrinos are as ubiquitous as they are cagey. In fact, neutrinos are the most abundant matter particles in the universe. According to Hitoshi Murayama of the University of Tokyo and the University of California, Berkeley, there are a billion neutrinos for every atom in the universe. He contends that &#x201c;their sheer number means they have an important role. The contribution of neutrinos to the cosmic energy budget is comparable to that of all the stars.&#x201d; In fact, about a hundred trillion neutrinos produced in the nuclear furnace at the Sun&#x2019;s core pass through your body every second of the day <i>and</i> night, yet they do no harm and leave no trace. During your entire lifetime, perhaps one single neutrino would interact with an atom in your body. Neutrinos travel right through the Earth unhindered, like bullets cutting through fog. Besides, the Earth&#x2019;s bowels generate neutrinos, as radioactive elements decay, and so do collisions of energetic particles from space in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Cataclysmic deaths of massive stars set off tremendous bursts of neutrinos, which escape these sites of mayhem unscathed and bring us news of awesome celestial events millions of light-years away. Moreover, our planet is immersed in a sea of cosmic neutrinos, which sprang forth when the infant universe was barely two seconds old. <br>The bizarre traits of neutrinos have turned them into pop culture icons of sorts. As far back as 1960, John Updike celebrated them in a delightful poem published in <i>The New Yorker</i>. Titled &#x201c;Cosmic Gall,&#x201d; it described how neutrinos traverse the Earth as easily as dust bunnies travel down a drafty hall or light passes through a sheet of glass. Klaatu, a Canadian progressive rock band perhaps best remembered for false rumors that they were the Beatles recording under a pseudonym, described the same phantom behavior, of neutrinos passing right through our bodies without alerting us, in the lyrics of a 1976 song. Neutrinos have even starred as hipster characters in the animated television series <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>. <br>Not surprisingly, references to neutrinos have also popped up on the popular sitcom <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>, in which two of the main characters are physicists. The show&#x2019;s science consultant, David Saltzberg of the University of California, Los Angeles, is himself a physicist who works on neutrino telescopes, among other topics. In one scene, the co-lead Sheldon Cooper is fiddling with equations on a whiteboard in his office when his fellow physicist and roommate Leonard Hofstadter enters along with their engineer friend Howard Wolowitz. Sheldon exclaims, &#x201c;Oh, there&#x2019;s my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren&#x2019;t you, you little subatomic Dickens?&#x201d; Instead of acknowledging his friend&#x2019;s greeting, he continues, &#x201c;Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.&#x201d; Howard responds drily, &#x201c;Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.&#x201d; <br>Neutrinos have made numerous appearances in science fiction, of course, typically as the culprits behind strange or catastrophic events. In Robert J. Sawyer&#x2019;s novel <i>Flashforward</i>, a burst of neutrinos from a dying star is responsible for making everyone lose consciousness briefly and see themselves as they would be some twenty-one years in the future. In Greg Bear&#x2019;s <i>Foundation and Chaos</i>, a freak neutrino storm wipes out the rules that robots are programmed to follow (� la Isaac Asimov&#x2019;s original Foundation series), resulting in complete mayhem. More recently, neutrinos were blamed for heating the Earth&#x2019;s core, triggering ferocious earthquakes and floods, in the Hollywood disaster flick <i>2012</i> directed by Roland Emmerich. <br>Despite neutrinos&#x2019; quirky appeal as cultural icons, few people outside the physics community paid much attention to the science of real-life neutrinos until they made headlines recently for possibly breaking the cosmic speed limit set by Albert Einstein back in 1905. A large international collaboration of physicists known as OPERA (acronym for the unwieldy title Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus) made the startling announcement in a research paper posted online and at a press conference in late September of 2011. The particles appeared to travel faster than light between CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research and its Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland, and an underground detector 454 miles away in Gran Sasso, Italy, arriving 60 nanoseconds sooner than expected. <br>Despite the OPERA spokesman&#x2019;s cautionary words, and skepticism from the vast majority of neutrino researchers, the news reverberated around the globe. Perhaps the commotion was not surprising given the astounding implications. If true, the finding would violate Einstein&#x2019;s theory of special relativity, a cornerstone of modern physics. As <i>Time</i> magazine put it, &#x201c;If the Europeans are right, Einstein was not just wrong but almost clueless.&#x201d; Most physicists and journalists emphasized that the extraordinary claim required further investigation and independent verification. &#x201c;If true, it is a result that would change the world. But that &#x2018;if&#x2019; is enormous,&#x201d; said <i>The New York Times</i>. <br>But all that hedging failed to rein in rampant speculations about superluminal voyages and grandiose visions of new physics. Suddenly jokes about neutrino time travel were everywhere. Some quipped that neutrinos had obeyed the law in Switzerland but broken the speed ...</p><h2>School For Good &amp; Evil 2 World Without</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Until age eight or so, that was all I pretty much watched. Everything I learned about storytelling, I learned from Disney. When I went to college, though, I became fascinated by the gap between the original tales and these Disney revisions. As a relentless student of the Grimms&#x2019; stories, what I loved about them was how unsafe the characters were. You could very well end up with wedding bells and an Ever After&#x2014;or you could lose your tongue or be baked into a pie. There was no &#x201c;warmth&#x201d; built into the narrator, no expectations of a happy ending. The thrill came from vicariously trying to survive the gingerbread house, the hook-handed captain, or the apple-carrying crone at the door&#x2014;and relief upon survival. Somewhere in that gap between the Disney stories and the retellings, The School for Good and Evil was born. In recent years, fairy-tale mash-ups, retellings, and revisions have become popular&#x2014;and for good reason, given how enduring and inspiring the source material is. That said, I had my sights set on something more primal: a new fairy tale, just as unleashed and unhinged as the old, that found the anxieties of today&#x2019;s children. To acknowledge the past&#x2014;the alumni of the genre, so to speak&#x2014;and move on to a new class. As soon as I started thinking in those terms, I knew I wanted to do a school-based novel. I was walking in Regents Park in London before a meeting when I had the first image . . . a girl in pink and a girl in black falling into the wrong schools. . . . I got so caught up thinking that I missed my appointment entirely.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Which school do you think you would belong to? Why?</b> <p></p> <p>I can be comically high maintenance (my friends joke that Sophie is the real me), so I&#x2019;d surely be an overachieving Ever and the most regular user of the Groom Room (the medieval spa, which only the top-ranked students are allowed to use). That said, Evil&#x2019;s classes have no boundaries&#x2014;for sheer entertainment value alone, I can see the allure. That&#x2019;s if I had a choice. In the process of writing the book, I realized I wasn&#x2019;t quite sure which school I would actually end up in&#x2014;so I created an online assessment to answer that question. I wrote all the questions myself and there&#x2019;s a bank of over 100, so the questions change every time. I&#x2019;ve taken it a number of times, trying to be as honest as I can, and I always end up 75% Evil and 25% Good. Those who read the novel will agree that this isn&#x2019;t a surprising result in the least.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Which class would you most like to take?</b> <p></p> <p>Henchmen Training, for sure. I just think the challenge of trying to wrangle these rabid, nasty creatures who hate the idea of being subservient henchmen sounds like a recipe for complete disaster and drama . . . two things I adore.</p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <b>Describe The School for Good and Evil in three words.</b> <p></p> <ul> <li>Intense</li> <li>Mischievous</li> <li>Effervescent</li> </ul><p>In the epic sequel to the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling novel <em>The School for Good and Evil</em>, Sophie and Agatha are home, living out their Ever After.

Some attempt to explain how children were conceived or adopted, and others reassure children that having a family that's different is okay. As a gay parent, I'm glad to see this list, but the books I buy my 4-year-old are not about having same-sex parents, or adult relationships, or political correctness. Instead, they're about kids doing kid things and thinking kid thoughts while their two moms or two dads pop up here and there, as parents are inclined to do from time to time. One of the nice things about kids' books is that they build self-confidence by normalizing children's experiences. Just as children with heterosexual parents read books that mirror their families without making the parents' relationship the focus of the book, children of same-sex parents benefit from reading books that feature families like theirs. But, of course, kids' favorite books are centered on a topic that toddlers care about almost exclusively: themselves! </p> <p> </p> <p>This is a lovely story that can [also] serve as an opportunity to learn about different traditions . . ." -- <em>Parents Magazine</em></p> (<i>Magazine</i>)<br><br><p>"People forget that Superman is an alien. This book is a reminder that that&#x2019;s the source of his strength.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s a secret that isn&#x2019;t taught in school: Everyone has a superpower. It might be drawing monsters or kindness to strangers or the ability to read an unusual number of books. Nate&#x2019;s power is that he feels like an alien. He&#x2019;s the only boy in his class with two fathers, Daddy and Abba. All the boys in Nate&#x2019;s Hebrew school class are dressing up as superheroes for Purim, but Nate really wants a green costume with antennae. (Comic-book fans would, of course, suggest that he dress as the Martian Manhunter.) 'Sometimes showing who you really are makes you stronger,' Abba says, 'even if you&#x2019;re different from other people.' Nate&#x2019;s secret power gives him unusual creativity, and his solution wins him an award for most original costume. Byrne&#x2019;s illustrations make the ending especially satisfying, with half-a-dozen young superheroes standing around in tennis shoes. (Longtime superhero fans, however, will feel old when they see Wolverine in a picture book.) A generation from now, this book may feel hopelessly outdated: A moral about tolerance and being yourself may seem painfully obvious. Many will view this as a sign of progress. If that happens, it will be because of the work of heroes like Nate.</p> <p>For now, this book is both timely and entirely satisfying." --<em>Kirkus Reviews </em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"PreS-Gr 2--Nate is having a hard time choosing a costume for his synagogue's Purim celebration. All the boys in his Hebrew class plan to dress as superheroes, but he is much more interested in aliens. With help from his two fathers (Daddy and Abba) and inspired by the story of Queen Esther, he comes up with a 'Super Alien' outfit. Rabbi Joanie, dressed as a clown, awards him the prize for most original costume, and everyone is left smiling. The cartoon illustrations are bright and fun, depicting children at Hebrew school, Nate's home life, the Purim festival, details such as kippot worn at school and meals, and Abba's sewing machine ready to make costumes for Nate and his sister, Miri. With warmth and humor, this picture book demonstrates the Purim principle of standing up for one's beliefs.

A young woman goes missing from the streets of New York. Those who have taken her believe that nobody cares about her, and that no one will come looking for her. They are wrong. She is &#39;blood&#39; to the killer Louis, the man who stands at the right hand of private detective Charlie Parker, and Louis will tear apart anyone who stands in the way of his attempts to find her. But as Louis&#39; violent search progresses, Parker comes to realize that the disappearance is part of an older mystery, one that is linked to an ornate church of bones in Eastern Europe, to the slaughter at a French monastery in 1944, and to the quest for a mythical prize that has been sought for centuries by evil men: the Black Angel. Yet, the Black Angel is more than a myth. It is conscious. It dreams. It is alive. And men are not the only creatures that seek it ...</p><p>John Connolly was born in Dublin in 1968. His debut -EVERY DEAD THING - swiftly launched him right into the front rank of thriller writers, and all his subsequent novels have been Sunday Times bestsellers. He is the first non-American writer to win the US Shamus award.The Black Angel PROLOGUE<p></p> <br>The rebel angels fell, garlanded with fire.<br> <br>And as they descended, tumbling through the void, they were cursed as the newly blind are cursed, for just as the darkness is more terrible for those who have known the light, so the absence of grace is felt more acutely by those who once dwelt in its warmth. The angels screamed in their torment, and their burning brought brightness to the shadows for the first time. The lowest of them cowered in the depths, and there they created their own world in which to dwell.<br> <br>As the last angel fell, he looked to heaven and saw all that was to be denied him for eternity, and the vision was so terrible to him that it burned itself upon his eyes. And so, as the skies closed above him, it was given to him to witness the face of God disappear among gray clouds, and the beauty and sorrow of the image was imprinted forever in his memory, and upon his sight. He was cursed to walk forever as an outcast, shunned even by his own kind, for what could be more agonizing for them than to see, each time they looked in his eyes, the ghost of God flickering in the blackness of his pupils?<br> <br>And so alone was he that he tore himself in two, that he might have company in his long exile, and together these twin parts of the same being wandered the still-forming earth. In time, they were joined by a handful of the fallen who were weary of cowering in that bleak kingdom of their own creation. After all, what is hell but the eternal absence of God? To exist in a hellish state is to be denied forever the promise of hope, of redemption, of love. To those who have been forsaken, hell has no geography.<br> <br>But these angels at last grew weary of roaming throughout the desolate world without an outlet for their rage and their despair. They found a deep, dark place in which to sleep, and there they secreted themselves away and waited. And after many years, mines were dug, and tunnels lit, and the deepest and greatest of these excavations was among the Bohemian silver mines at Kutn� Hora, and it was called Kank.<br> <br>And it was said that when the mine reached its final depth, the lights carried by the miners flickered as though troubled by a breeze where no breeze could exist, and a great sighing was heard, as of souls released from their bondage. A stench of burning arose, and tunnels collapsed, trapping and killing those beneath. A storm of filth and dirt emerged, sweeping through the mine, choking and blinding all in its path. Those who survived spoke of voices in the abyss, and the beating of wings in the midst of the clouds. The storm ascended toward the main shaft, bursting forth into the night sky, and the men who saw it glimpsed a redness at its heart, as though it were all aflame.<br> <br>And the rebel angels took upon themselves the appearance of men, and set about creating a kingdom that they might rule through stealth and the corrupted will of others. They were led by the twin demons, the greatest of their number, the Black Angels. The first, called Ashmael, immersed himself in the fires of battle, and whispered empty promises of glory into the ears of ambitious rulers. The other, called Immael, waged his own war upon the church and its leaders, the representatives upon the earth of the One who had banished his brother. He gloried in fire and rape, and his shadow fell upon the sacking of monasteries and the burning of chapels. Each half of this twin being bore the mark of God as a white mote in his eye, Ashmael in his right eye and Immael in his left.<br> <br>But in his arrogance and wrath, Immael allowed himself to be glimpsed for a moment in his true, blighted form. He was confronted by a Cistercian monk named Erdric from the monastery at Sedlec, and they fought above vats of molten silver in a great foundry. At last, Immael was cast down, caught in the moment of transformation from human to Other, and he fell into the hot ore. Erdric called for the metal to be slowly cooled, and Immael was trapped in silver, powerless to free himself from this purest of prisons.<br> <br>And Ashmael felt his pain, and sought to free him, but the monks hid Immael well, and kept him from those who would release him from his bonds. Yet Ashmael never stopped seeking his brother, and in time he was joined in his search by those who shared his nature, and by men corrupted by his promises. They marked themselves so that they might be known to one another, and their mark was a grapnel, a forked hook, for in the old lore this was the first weapon of the fallen angels.<br> <br>And they called themselves &#x201c;Believers.&#x201d;|The Black Angel CHAPTER<p></p> I<p></p> <br>The woman stepped carefully from the Greyhound bus, her right hand holding firmly on to the bar as she eased herself down. A relieved sigh escaped from her lips once both feet were on level ground, the relief that she always felt when a simple task was negotiated without incident. She was not old&#x2014;she was barely into her fifties&#x2014;but she looked, and felt, much older. She had endured a great deal, and accumulated sorrows had intensified the predations of the years. Her hair was silver-gray, and she had long since ceased making the monthly trek to the salon to have its color altered. There were horizontal lines stretching from the corner of each eye, like healed wounds, paralleled by similar lines on her forehead. She knew how she had come by them, for occasionally she caught herself wincing as if in pain while she looked in the mirror or saw herself reflected in the window of a store, and the depth of those lines increased with the transformation in her expression. It was always the same thoughts, the same memories, that caused the change, and always the same faces that she recalled: the boy, now a man; her daughter, as she once was and as she now might be; and the one who had made her little girl upon her, his face sometimes contorted, as it was at the moment of her daughter&#x2019;s conception, and at other times tattered and destroyed, as it was before they closed the coffin lid upon him, erasing at last his physical presence from the world.<br> <br>Nothing, she had come to realize, will age a woman faster than a troubled child. In recent years, she had become prone to the kind of accidents that bedeviled the lives of women two or three decades older than she, and took longer to recover from them than once she had. It was the little things that she had to look out for: unanticipated curbs, neglected cracks in the sidewalk, the unexpected jolting of a bus as she rose from her seat, the forgotten water spilled upon the kitchen floor. She feared these things more than she feared the young men who congregated in the parking lot of the strip mall near her home, watching for the vulnerable, for those whom they considered easy prey. She knew that she would never be one of their victims, as they were more afraid of her than they were of the police, or of their more vicious peers, for they knew of the man who waited in the shadows of her life. A small part of her hated the fact that they feared her, even as she enjoyed the protection that it brought. Her protection was hard bought, purchased, she believed, with the loss of a soul.<br> <br>She prayed for him, sometimes. While the others wailed &#x201c;Hallelujah&#x201d; to the preacher, beating their breasts and shaking their heads, she remained silent, her chin to her chest, and pleaded softly. In the past, a long time ago, she would ask the Lord that her nephew might turn again to His radiant light and embrace the salvation that lay only in relinquishing violent ways. Now she no longer wished for miracles. Instead, as she thought about him, she begged God that, when this lost sheep at last stood before Him for the final judgment, He would be merciful and forgive him his trespasses; that He would look closely at the life he had lived and find within it those little acts of decency that might enable Him to offer succor to this sinner.<br> <br>But perhaps there were some lives that could never be redeemed, and some sins so terrible that they were beyond forgiveness. The preacher said that the Lord forgives all, but only if the sinner truly acknowledges his fault and seeks another path. If this was true, then she feared that her prayers would count for nothing, and he was damned to eternity.<br> <br>She showed her ticket to the man unloading the baggage from the bus. He was gruff and unfriendly to her, but he appeared to be that way to everyone. Young men and women hovered watchfully at the periphery of the light from the bus&#x2019;s windows, like wild animals fearful of the fire yet hungry for those who lay within the circle of its warmth. Her handbag gripped to her chest, she took her case by its handle and wheeled it toward the escalator. She watched those around her, heedful of the warnings of her neighbors back home.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t accept no offers of help. Don&#x2019;t be talking to nobody seems like he just offerin&#x2019; to assist a lady with her bag, don&#x2019;t matter how well he dressed or how sweetly he sings. . . .<br> <br>But there were no offers of help, and she ascended without incident to the busy streets of this alien city, as foreign to her as Cairo or Rome might have been, dirty and crowded and unforgiving. She had scribbled an address on a piece of paper, along with the directions she had painstakingly transcribed over the phone from the man at the hotel, hearing the impatience in his voice as he was forced to repeat the address, the name of the hotel near incomprehensible to her when spoken in his thick immigrant accent.<br> <br>She walked the streets, pulling her bag behind her. She carefully noted the numbers at the intersections, trying to take as few turns as possible, until she came to the big police building. There she waited for another hour, until at last a policeman came to talk to her. He had a thin file in front of him, but she could add nothing to what she had told him over the phone, and he could tell her only that they were doing what they could. Still, she filled out more papers, in the hope that some small detail she provided might lead them to her daughter, then left and hailed a cab on the street. She passed the piece of paper with the address of her hotel through a small hole in the Plexiglas screen. She asked the driver how much it would cost to go there, and he shrugged. He was an Asian man, and he did not look pleased to see the scribbled destination.<br> <br>&#x201c;Traffic. Who knows?&#x201d;<br> <br>He waved a hand at the slow-moving streams of cars and trucks and buses. Horns honked loudly, and drivers shouted angrily at one another. All was impatience and frustration, overshadowed by buildings that were too high, out of scale with those who were expected to live and work inside and outside them. She could not understand how anyone would choose to remain in such a place.<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty, maybe,&#x201d; said the cabdriver.<br> <br>She hoped it would be less than twenty. Twenty dollars was a lot, and she did not know how long she would have to stay here. She had booked the hotel room for three days, and had sufficient funds to cover another three days after that, as long as she ate cheaply and could master the intricacies of the subway. She had read about it, but had never seen it in reality and had no concept of its operations. She knew only that she did not like the thought of descending beneath the earth, into the darkness, but she could not afford to take cabs all the time. Buses might be better. At least they stayed aboveground, slowly though they seemed to move in this city.<br> <br>He might offer her money, of course, once she found him, but she would refuse any such offer, just as she had always refused it, carefully returning the checks that he sent to the only contact address that she had for him. His money was tainted, just as he was tainted, but she needed his help now: not his money, but his knowledge. Something terrible had happened to her daughter, of that she was certain, even if she could not explain how she knew.<br> <br>Alice, oh Alice, why did you have to come to this place?<br> <br>Her own mother had been blessed, or cursed, with the gift. She knew when someone was suffering, and could sense when harm had come to anyone who was dear to her. The dead talked to her. They told her things. Her life was filled with whispers. The gift had not been passed on, and for that the woman was grateful, but she wondered sometimes if a faint trace of it had not found its way into her, a mere spark of the great power that had dwelt in her mother. Or perhaps all mothers were cursed with the ability to sense their children&#x2019;s deepest sufferings, even when they were far, far from them. All that she could say for sure was that she had not known a moment&#x2019;s peace in recent days, and that she heard her daughter&#x2019;s voice calling to her when sleep fleetingly came.<br> <br>She would tell that to him when she met him, in the hope that he would understand. Even if he did not, she knew that he would help, for the girl was blood to him.<br> <br>And if there is one thing that he understood, it was blood.<br> <br>I PARKED IN AN alleyway about fifty feet from the house, then covered the rest of the distance on foot. I could see Jackie Garner hunched behind the wall bordering the property. He wore a black wool hat, a black jacket, and black jeans. His hands were uncovered, and his breath formed phantoms in the air. Beneath his jacket I made out the word SYLVIA written on his T-shirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;New girlfriend?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Jackie pulled open his jacket so I could see the T-shirt more clearly. It read, TIM &#x2018;THE MAINE-IAC&#x2019; SYLVIA, a reference to one of our local-boys-made-good, and featured a poor caricature of the great man himself. In September 2002, Tim Sylvia, all six-eight and 260 pounds of him, became the first Mainer to compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, eventually going on to take the Heavyweight Championship title in Las Vegas in 2003, knocking down the undefeated champion, Ricco Rodriguez, with a right cross in the first round. &#x201c;I hit him hahd,&#x201d; Sylvia told a postmatch interviewer, making every Down-Easter with flattened vowel sounds feel instantly proud. Unfortunately, Sylvia tested positive for anabolic steroids after his first defense, against the six-eleven Gan &#x201c;The Giant&#x201d; McGee, and voluntarily surrendered his belt and title. I remembered Jackie telling me once that he&#x2019;d attended the fight. Some of McGee&#x2019;s blood had landed on his jeans, and he now saved them for special wear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got a friend who makes them. I can let you have some cheap.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t take them any other way. In fact, I wouldn&#x2019;t take them at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackie was offended. For a guy who might have passed for Tim Sylvia&#x2019;s out-of-condition older brother, he was pretty sensitive.<br> <br>&#x201c;How many are there in the house?&#x201d; I asked, but his attention had already wandered on to another subject.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, we&#x2019;re dressed the same,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re dressed the same. Look: you got the hat, the same jacket, the jeans. Except you got gloves and I got this T-shirt, we could be twins.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackie Garner was a good guy, but I thought that he might be a little crazy. Someone once told me that a shell accidentally went off close to him when he was serving with the U.S. Army in Berlin just before the Wall came down. He was unconscious for a week, and for six months after he awoke he couldn&#x2019;t remember anything that happened later than 1983. Even though he was mostly recovered, there were still gaps in his memory, and he occasionally confused the guys at Bull Moose Music by asking for &#x201c;new&#x201d; CDs that were actually fifteen years old.

Entire relationships are encapsulated in a few, stingingly perfect lines: "Colleen was Walter's ex-girlfriend from med school. She loved to dance with men at weddings." Pricking our insecurities, Shapton introduces us to Kim, whose ex "kept a drawerful of love letters in a kitchen drawer . . . She would stare at it while she cooked." And Ben's ex, "a physiotherapist for the U.S. men's and women's Olympic swim teams. She wore small white shorts year-round."<br><br>Fascinated by her own jealousy, Shapton interviewed acquaintances about their anxieties and peccadilloes, and the result is a book of surpassing originality: one of those unusual books that comes along to delight us all, like <i>An Exaltation of Larks</i> or <i>Love, Loss, and What I Wore</i> or <i>Griffin and Sabine</i>. <i>Was She Pretty?</i> can also share the shelf with the work of the legendary William Steig, whose early, psychologically revealing work inspired Shapton. An unflinching observer of human behavior, she invites us to peer into the hearts and minds of her characters--while reminding us that we shouldn't be surprised if we see ourselves staring right back.<br></p><p><b>Leanne Shapton</b> is an art director, illustrator, artist, and publisher based in New<br>York.

His enquiries plunge him into the shadow world behind the fashionable facade of Shepherd's Bush, among the victims of the Welfare State and the crime barons who prey on them; a world where no one is what they seem, and lying to the police is second nature. Slider's thankless task is to convince the witnesses, against all available evidence, that honesty really is the best policy. And with his lover Joanna away, fate seems suddenly determined to strew his private life with temptations . . .<br>DEAR DEPARTED: It looks as though Inspector Bill Slider has a serial killer on his patch: 'The Park Killer', as the media so innovatively label him, attacks his victims in London's public parks, and when Chattie Cornfield is murder while out jogging, the pattern fits. But as Slider and Atherton investigate, it is Chattie's life, rather than the killer's, that poses questions. What was she involved with? Where did she spend the last day of her life? And was it love or hate that drove the hooded figure to kill her?</p></p><p><b>Cynthia Harrod-Eagles</b> is the author of the hugely popular Morland Dynasty novels, which have captivated and enthralled readers for decades.

A first novel.</p><p>Rajaa Alsanea grew up in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the daughter of a family of doctors. She currently lives in Chicago, where she is pursuing a degree in endodontics. Rajaa intends to return to Saudi Arabia after attaining her degree. She is twenty-five years old, and this is her first novel.This is chick lit with a major difference: It gives us four upper-class Saudi girlfriends who hope for true love and fulfilling marriage just as much as Elizabeth Bennet ever did--but in a very modern cultural setting far more confining as to womens power over their own futures than eighteenth-century England ever was. As social history it is fascinating. The translation from Arabic seems fluent; the author has provided many necessary footnotes explaining cultural semiotics (dress, accents, food, worship) whose import the non-Saudi reader would miss. Kate Reading handles these gracefully, and her Arabic pronunciation is confidence-inspiring. Best, she delivers believable, sympathetic characters and keeps the pot on the boil. This book is an eye-opener.

In this pioneering history, Nancy F. Cott demonstrates that marriage is and always has been a public institution. </p><p> From the founding of the United States to the present day, imperatives about the necessity of marriage and its proper form have been deeply embedded in national policy, law, and political rhetoric. Legislators and judges have envisioned and enforced their preferred model of consensual, lifelong monogamy--a model derived from Christian tenets and the English common law that posits the husband as provider and the wife as dependent. In early confrontations with Native Americans, emancipated slaves, Mormon polygamists, and immigrant spouses, through the invention of the New Deal, federal income tax, and welfare programs, the federal government consistently influenced the shape of marriages. And even the immense social and legal changes of the last third of the twentieth century have not unraveled official reliance on marriage as a "pillar of the state." </p><p> By excluding some kinds of marriages and encouraging others, marital policies have helped to sculpt the nation's citizenry, as well as its moral and social standards, and have directly affected national understandings of gender roles and racial difference. <i>Public Vows</i> is a panoramic view of marriage's political history, revealing the national government's profound role in our most private of choices. No one who reads this book will think of marriage in the same way again. </p></p><p><b>Nancy F. Cott</b> is Professor of History at Harvard University.In this exhaustively researched study...[Cott] posits a monolithic Christian monogamous marriage, formed by the mutual consent of a man and a woman, as American colonists' model. This model, she argues, was congruent with the political ideal of representative government: the Constitution's 'more perfect union' was likened to the domestic ideal of marital union. Entry to marriage, Cott observes, has been regulated by the states, which have also used their power to limit this civil right. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2000-11-13)<br><br>In this fascinating study, Cott examines the evolution and impact of marriage law on the American social structure...Presented in a clear, chronological fashion, this work provides a wealth of thought-provoking information. Highly recommended. (Rose Cichy <i>Library Journal</i> 2001-01-01)<br><br>Christian monogamy and property rights have been crucial to state and federal policies on marriage ever since the American republic was born, and how Americans have felt about marriage has affected much larger developments than the joining of one man and one woman in matrimony...[According to <i>Public Vows</i>,] marriage is now much less a matter of public policy--an institution--than one of private accommodation--a contract. Cott's cool, intelligent overview is sometimes demanding but always absorbing. (Ray Olson <i>Booklist</i> 2001-01-01)<br><br>As a historian, Nancy Cott is not obligated to look into the future. But her incisive illumination and readable analysis of the weight of history will help both scholars and activists who wish to understand and help shape the future of marriage and family life. (E.
